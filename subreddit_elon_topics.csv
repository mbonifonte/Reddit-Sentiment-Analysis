> The US government needs a way to ensure that companies won&#039;t get the nation in trouble by violating the Outer Space Treaty while in space.

> SpaceX has not been silent about its deep space ambitions, and once the Falcon Heavy is online, the company has even bigger plans for the rocket beyond launching cars.

38,The myth of Elon Musk,104,8ztj80,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8ztj80/the_myth_of_elon_musk/,39,1531930004.0,"Hey guys. I've been following the Musk/Tesla story very closely over the past few months and have come to realize what a horrible human being he really is. I've always seen him as a flashy showoff who never really achieves anything but digging into his story really shocked me on what a fraud he truly is. It's nauseating how the world bows down before this sick man and I would like to do my part in getting the truth out. I'd like to compile a piece exposing the myths of Musk. Please bring forward comments, suggestions, ideas, sources and tips to improve what I've outlined below. I know there are some talented writers out there and would be happy to hand this over to anyone who could do better. It's a stretch but I really hope a major publication will publish this piece. If not at least I will leave behind some evidence for future generations on what a douche this man really is. 

1) Great businessman. This is by far the easiest to refute. None of Musk  businesses have been anywhere near the stellar success as protrayed his by fans. A product of right place at the right time describes Musk's early success. 
  a) zip2 - Purchased by Compaq in Feb 1999 at the peak of the dotcom boom where any company with a .com suffix was worth 
millions. In other words, he got really lucky. 
  b) x.com - need more info on this one
  c) Paypal: Founded as a merger between x.com and and Confinity. Musk was ousted after a few months long before Paypal      
became the famous name it is today. 
  d) Tesla: Started by Martin Eberjard and Marc Tarpening NOT Elon Musk. Tesla as we all know has never made a dime. They've 
specialized in selling massively expensive cars with Government subsidies to rich people, mostly in california. Today 15 years later tesla commands a 0.1% worldwide market share. They've done nothing to introduce EV cars to the masses. Tesla in it's current state is closer to bankruptcy than disrupting the auto industry or making EV's mainstream.
  e) Spacex:  A privately held company but more than likely a major money loser. Spacex personifies Musk's business acumen -     Make a big noise about something revolutionary and just hope it will magically come together. Spacex is using the same  
decades-old rocket technology (developed by the Government) and undercutting their competitors in order to gain market  
share. They've done nothing revolutionary while sucking on the Government's teat - as Musk is prone to do. They are either losing millions per launch or delivering alot less than they claim. (I need rocket industry experts to expand on this one)
  f) The Boring Company:  Produced a few overpriced flamethrowers. No tunnels dug. No hyperloop. Nothing more than a fantasy company to indulge Musks impractical ""visions"".
 
2) Visionary: A visionary is defined as a person who ""thinks about the future with imagination or wisdom"". Musk comes across 
more as a sci-fi or fantasy writer than visionary. His ideas are hardly practical or reasonable and won't be in the foreseeable future. The difference between vision and fantasy is that vision should be achievable in a reasonable time frame, probably no more than 20 - 30 years in the future. I also have a vision that one day I'll be able to travel to the Andromeda Galaxy and meet wonderful aliens - that doesn't make me a visionary. 

3) Genius: A word thrown around far too frequently and in Musk's case I have zero doubt he doesn't qualify. A genius is defined as someone of exceptional creative or other natural ability. Einstein was a genius - he revolutionized physics. Ditto for Neils Bohr with Quantam Mechanics. The same for Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper in computer science. Prince was genius in his musical ability while Marie Curie was a genius scientist. These men and women accomplished in their respective fields feats which were extremely rare and won't likely be repeated for a long time. Musk has had no    
such impact. He claims to be a physicist/engineer yet he has done nothing revolutionary in either discipline. As far as I know the only thing he ever produced was the code he wrote for zip2. He's written no revolutionary papers, he's created no revolutionary products and thus far has left no lasting impact in any field. 
title. He might be a marketing genius since he has managed to fool many people into buying his hype :-)

3) Environmentalist: Musk wants to get rid of fossil fuels for the sake of the planet. His mission is all about sustainable clean energy. Unusually Musk travels to work in a private jet everyday. Wouldn't it be better for the environment if he just bought a house close to his factory? Think about that for a minute. An environmentalist who wants to eliminate fossil fuels travels to work everyday on his own private jet. And absurdly he's got the money to move closer or drive. 
His environmental claims would mean a lot more if he did something about increasing the use of public transport, especially in a state like California. Reduction of the number of cars on the road is the answer - not adding more, irrespective of how that car is powered. There are countless other programs that can make a meaningful impact yet Musk has ignored them all in favor of selling expensive cars to wealthy people. Even symbolic gestures don't feature in his so-called mission. Allow employees to work remotely. Making your buildings green. Fund mass transport in developing countries. He's done none of that but yet he's  managed to craft the illusion that he absolutely cares about the environment. Oh and he donates a load of money to the GOP. 
Their position on climate change is well known - they don't even accept that it's real. 

4) Caring and compassionate:  Musk cares about Musk. He's been shown to be an obnoxious, egotistical, narcissist who constantly needs the spotlight. He can't give credit to anyone and demands all for himself. He berates anyone who disagrees or doesn't worship the ground he walks on. When the media fawns over him he gloats but when they ask relevant questions they become the enemy. He insults employees, puts down executives in public, calls a diver who helped rescue children a pedophile. He sics his Twitter mob on anyone who even appears to disagree with him. They have a special penchant for harassing, berating and humiliating women while Musk looks the other way. He's become a billionaire with Government  and investor money but brags about coming to America with almost nothing.  He lives a playboy, jetsetting lifestyle while preaching to all and sundry and pretending to be the caring billionaire who wants to make the world a better place. Musk may just be the biggest hypocritical douchebag of our time. 

Please add/change/update whatever is relevant. All credit will be given. For anyone who wants to re-write the whole thing please feel free to do so. This is my outline and starting point. Hopefully the final version will be alot more comprehensive and better written. Thanks ahead. ",2018-07-18

51,A confession from a former fanboy,69,8zrhau,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8zrhau/a_confession_from_a_former_fanboy/,19,1531909221.0,"I used to think that Elon Musk was what everyone should become. He was selfless, smart, inventive, the whole nine yards. I used to think that most things he did (except for his Twitter) couldn't go wrong. After the recent comments, I began to realize the true scale of his deception to the world. Don't get me wrong, I still think he is a genius. However, he's a genius in the way Trump and G≈ìbbels are geniuses; through their deftness of incorporating you into their cult of personality. This makes many people think that he has done everything attributed to him by himself, but that's simply not true. Perhaps the only thing that makes him stand out from all of the Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires is his marketability as a *supergenius*. His ego gets wounded so easily that he usually retaliates (like on Twitter). I really think he probably should  have never been on Twitter, like the POTUS, for obvious reasons, so they could at least maintain a semblance of sanity in them. Even after all of this, I still fanboy over SpaceX, but not because of Musk. Gwynne Shotwell, the President of SpaceX, and Tom Mueller, CTO for rocket propulsion,(should just be CTO, but Elon wants that title too) have managed to make the company one of the most prolific, efficient, and cheap launchers of rockets today, launching more than any government. Perhaps the most impressive thing done by the company (not by Elon Musk at all) was the successful launch of the Falcon Heavy on the first try, which had 27 engines for its first stage. The N-1 had 30, in comparison, yet they didn't have all the fancy tech that we have today. In conclusion, I think that Musk is BS, but I still like SpaceX (pls don't hate).",2018-07-18

First of all, there are multiple anecdotes by people who thought he was crazy and wouldn't achieve such and such milestones (mainly SpaceX related but some Tesla ones as well). The book is a few years old now and sure enough he has achieved those milestones which makes the anecdotes sound silly in retrospect. 

Secondly, the author Ashlee Vance has filled the books with anecdotes from former employees discussing how they have witnessed firsthand Elon's unbelievable work ethic and brilliance. These anecdotes are reiterated during the Paypal, Tesla and SpaceX chapters and include colleagues such as investors, fired, and current employees. Would Vance really jeopardize his reputation by printing so many lies or invalid statements? There must be some truth to them. 

So my question: Have you guys read the biography and if so, how does it influence your views on Tesla and how Elon is running (or not running) the company?

The Musk post in r/wsb has thousands of upvotes i never saw a post in that sub with so many upvotes.

Whenever i open up the reddit app i either see Musks face, Musks rocket or this starman picture.

Every comment chain is filled with people worshipping Musk. ‚ÄûHe is actually contributing to science‚Äú, ‚ÄûElon Musk is to most important man in the world‚Äú, ‚ÄûElon Musk cured cancer‚Äú, ‚ÄûElon Musk made all our lifes better‚Äú, ‚ÄûWho cares if Elon Musk pays his workers like shit?‚Äú

The moment you say anything negative about Musk you will get downvoted.

Reddit lost its function and is pointless.

All you have is people worshipping a billionaire and his shady business tactics who hope to live on a fucking bare rock someday. I am convinced reddit is filled with retards, nerds, kids, pseudo science lovers and people with absolutely zero social environment or abilities.

Musk is a genius marketing man making billions of a company that never turned a profit, convincing people to put a deposit down for a car they never saw. Selling ‚Äûflamethrowers‚Äú for $500. This man exactly knows how his audience and fans think and he also knows exactly how to empty their pockets.

Even for the Model 3, people call Elon ‚Äûoptimistic‚Äú in his timeframes when in fact it is one of the most shady business tactics. Making overly positive promises like FSD in just 2 years, 5000/week Model 3s by 2017 and so on to get people commit themselves to buy this car and reserve it. Once that happens all these goals get pushed for years, Alcantara headliners get removed and the 35k version isnt even available but people will just buy the more expensive version even if they never planned that.

This phenomen is called the ‚ÄûEscalation of commitment‚Äú and as i said, one of the most shady business tactics to use. The definition of wiki perfectly describes everyone of the 500k Model 3 reservation holders:

>Escalation of commitment is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some decision, action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment

All of Musks strategies are build on top of this fundamental principle. Rather than accepting this people will call him optimistic. Other CEOs would have been laughed out of the room as morons who obviously have no clue about their companies real engineering capabilities if they regularly set such unrealistic timeframes - but Musk? Nah hes just optimistic and wants to motivate his workers. Maybe try to motivate with an industry standard payment?

He's an asshole and I hate him. You should hate him too. He's a lot like Donald Trump, lots of promises and lots of words, but very little action. He relies on appealing to one's emotion and excitement.

You ever wonder why there's not many Tesla/Elon Musk ads on TV, Radio or on billboards? It's because the majority of these hundreds of millions go towards Online Advertising.

This is also why Elon Musk and his companies refuse to travel outside of America. Other nations have laws that protect consumers so they know what they're seeing, but America doesn't because it's Corporation before Community.
