I know this doesn’t really give a solid answer but there isn’t one. Personally, I would invest, because Musk seems to have a way of making these things work. Right now the only issue is his ability to delivery model 3s on time. They only shipped 2000 cars last year out of 600000+ preorders.

when you enter into business, in any industry there are 1 million things that are going to be unfair about your business and the labor market, whether it’s employee wages, company benefits, labor hours, human rights, unions, etc. But to run a successful business and profitable one, you play by the rules/regulations of the industry. Your competitors are playing by those same rules, and you’re in competition with them for business.
There is no doubt Musk could spend all his time being an activist trying to run a billion dollar business. Righting the wrongs of the industry that his competitors have fought for. But then he wouldn’t have time to be an engineer, or head of spacex.

This discussion reminds of when I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zd8ulb8l5U&app=desktop) video of billionaire warren buffet talk about his thoughts on the GOPs 2017 tax reform. In this interview he says, “I wouldn’t have made tax reform this way” I make 19 million a year and I pay as much as someone who makes 125k yr, but I’m legally obligated by my shareholders to accept this reform(free money)when it’s given to me. The tax plan is not making anything more fair, but there’s not much I can do about it because I have a business to run and “hungry” shareholders to answer to. 
And I’m in the business of investments not activism.

Musk is in the same situation. Elon is in the business of interplanetary colonization, not tax legislation/ equality/human rights/etc. His businesses need to be nimble enough to win work and to profit to fund his ambitions. No profit no ambitions.

You are missing the entire point. Look beyond the 20 or so years you can't seem to get out of. Earth isn't going to last forever, we are using far to many resources and if an extinction level event happens humanity is gone. Even if every single country in the world did everything it could to help Earth (like 1st world countries already should be) it would only be delaying the inevitable, we are already too far gone to halt climate change completely. Having a second or multiple planets that we can create colony on and start fresh would help humanity continue, who knows technology and science might get to the point where we could terraform and have cities. Don't tell me it's some psuedo-science and that it won't happen because you have absolutely no idea that it won't.  

You don't know everything and nothing is impossible, especially when there is so much of the universe *and* science that we have yet to find out. You exist in a group of people that have said in the past that Musk ""couldn't do this"" or ""can't do that"" all of which he has proven wrong in the past and will more than likely prove you wrong in the future. Just because something hasn't been tested or is ""proven science"" doesn't  mean it can't become proven science. That's why we do these things, that's why musk wants to do these things.

519,23166,7w5ubz,"Dude, what are you talking about.  The Falcon Heavy basically shatters the competition in cost vs payload to orbit.  Yes there have been comparably powerful rockets in the past, but they were expensive and obviously not reusable.  Also, regardless of what was built in the past, they aren't  around anymore.  To say we already did that or better, don't bother building it would hinder innovation, we need to take steps forward, not sit around waiting for a gigantic leap.  The SLS and other competitors  are an expensive, impractical joke.  Even if you hate the man,  recognize that his company is doing great things for an otherwise deathly slow and bureaucratic industry and had lost its public appeal.  They are driving competition, engergizing the public to get excited about space exploration again, and driving down cost.

What I have heard, being in the industry myself, is that he is far more active in the technical aspects of the company then you are putting on.  He obviously isn't doing technical design every day, but is making texhincal decisions beyond just where the money goes and what the brand is.   Funnily enough,  I agree with a bunch of your comment, but the way you presented it you just sound like someone that hates SpaceX and even musk himself just because people like to make memes about him.

 On top of that, your comment starts off by saying he doesn't do any of the tech work and is basically taking credit for employee accomplishments, then go on to shit on those accomplishments and downplay them, holding musk accountable for the shortcomings- you can't have it both ways.

when you enter into business, in any industry there are 1 million things that are going to be unfair about your business and the labor market, whether it’s employee wages, company benefits, labor hours, human rights, unions, etc. But to run a successful business and profitable one, you play by the rules/regulations of the industry. Your competitors are playing by those same rules, and you’re in competition with them for business.
There is no doubt Musk could spend all his time being an activist trying to run a billion dollar business. Righting the wrongs of the industry that his competitors have fought for. But then he wouldn’t have time to be an engineer, or head of spacex.

This discussion reminds of when I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zd8ulb8l5U&app=desktop) video of billionaire warren buffet talk about his thoughts on the GOPs 2017 tax reform. In this interview he says, “I wouldn’t have made tax reform this way” I make 19 million a year and I pay as much as someone who makes 125k yr, but I’m legally obligated by my shareholders to accept this reform(free money)when it’s given to me. The tax plan is not making anything more fair, but there’s not much I can do about it because I have a business to run and “hungry” shareholders to answer to. 
And I’m in the business of investments not activism.

Musk is in the same situation. Elon is in the business of interplanetary colonization, not tax legislation/ equality/human rights/etc. His businesses need to be nimble enough to win work and to profit to fund his ambitions. No profit no ambitions.

The legislators are the ones who have failed us, not musk. And every other billionaire who have profited from these bad decisions and done nothing to ever give anything back in anyway aside from their legal obligations.",duencuy,1518933264,2/18/2018,spacex,February-2018

It might even also apply to Internet paid ads (as in Tesla not paying for any of those either but I believe that is not measured by Kantor.)

The $26.3M, $28.6M, $3.4M('16, '15, '14) ""advertising"" #s are ostensibly primarily due to Solarcity and is noted as ""consolidated"" under ""Solarcity"" section in the the Tesla's 10-K retroactively when the two companies merged (http://ir.tesla.com/secfiling.cfm?filingid=1564590-17-3118&cik=1318605).

Toyota made a profit of $5.6 billion in the April-June quarter of 2017 *alone* - thats over a thousand dollars in *profit* per car sold that quarter.

We are just translating the world we see into math so it would be safe to say an intelligent species would also do the same.

There's a lot of assumptions there but I'd say there's actually really decent odds considering we know its pretty easy to do in the scope of our short existence and the fact that there are so many billions of galaxies that could potentially be infinite.

The fanboyism in this comment is high. They need to make significantly cheaper cars if they want to dominate the market. And no the Model 3 isn't cheap enough to do so especially when you can buy a Ford or Toyota for less than $20,000.

If anything all of his current companies and interests show that he is very interested in maintaining humanity's positive trajectory, and allowing it to improve in the future. All of his companies post paypal are basically founded on a single driving principle which will act to benefit humanity (electric cars, Mars and cheap space access, green home energy, high speed transportation, etc.). From that idea what he does is figure out how to get there in a commercially viable way. I think this is because he sees a commercial enterprise as an efficient way to achieve a goal. In contast, public funding for these things is too risk averse, and results in advances taking longer than required.

I think there are [legitimate criticisms](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243436/tesla-factory-worker-injuries-union-uaw) to be made when it comes to how he treats his workers, especially the blue collar workers in Tesla's factories. I also think that his line on AI, while mostly correct, is a bit simplistic; he often alludes to the Terminator and other AI-apocalypse stories which I think put the wrong imagine in peoples minds about the exact threat AI poses.

>Elon musk rode to school in a rolls royce each day, those computer lessons and that computer he used to make his video game was paid for by his rich emerald mine owning father.

I have no idea where you're getting your information from and I would love to see your sources. It wouldn't surprise me all that much, though. And, frankly, I don't really _care_ all that much. Plenty of rich kids had good computers in the '70s and '80s. Far few eventually built tech empires.

>Elon musk is not an engineer. Elon musk does not design jack crap.

Are you expecting me to just take your word for it? There are many instances where he has publicly demonstrated his knowledge of the things he works with. Without too much Googling I [found a story](http://qr.ae/TU1DMI) from someone who claims they were contacted by Musk out of the blue asking technical questions about a material they were an expert on.

So let me ask you: why do you believe what you believe? What do you think you know and how do you think you know it?

>Billionaires are not a good thing. In order for one to exist millions must be in poverty. Working.

Maybe. This is a complicated issue that is far beyond the scope of this discussion. Mind you, it is clear from the way you said ""millions must be in poverty"" that your understanding of economics is about as good as your understanding of AI. All I will do on this point is observe that your very first shot in this argument was to name two aerospace billionaires and complain that they were not as well known as Musk.

Okay, so have I. I say that Musk is an engineer and I have given you some of my evidence for believing that. You have stubbornly declared that he isn't and when pressed for evidence you give me nothing. Do you often win arguments this way?

""Empirical"" is not a magic word that makes arguments go away. You have to actually provide evidence to be able to say you're demonstrating something empirically.

I don't think your model of me is a good as you think it is, but I honestly don't care.

Buddy, I already told you. I don't do the whole 'hero worship' thing. I am _very_ good at calibration: my beliefs match the evidence I see. If you want to win this argument then being cynical and biting isn't going to help. The only thing that will sway me is _actual fucking evidence_.

A brief look at your history shows that you're a frequent 'contributor' to r/EnoughMuskSpam/ which makes me suspect that it is not me, but rather you, who is gravely biased on this account.

If you want to show that Musk is not the groundbreaking visionary he looks like, then you need to provide _evidence_ that he is not an engineer or otherwise not really the driving force behind the innovations made in self-driving technology, aerospace, electric vehicles, battery storage, ecommerce, and... drilling, I guess? (I'll admit that the 'Boring Company' seems like a mostly pointless idea) Anyway, Musk spearheaded efforts in all of those areas and both he and people who work at his companies claim he is a core part of the actual technical work they do.

And I'll just go ahead a say that it will not be enough to simply show that Musk is overblown in his media exposure. _Of course_ he is. That's what media _does_, they blow things up larger than life. But that isn't evidence against the work he's done.",dxickeg,1524002265,4/17/2018,musk,April-2018

However, I consider this weak evidence because he is self-taught and an engineering certification would be unnecessary and redundant for him.

Yeah. Then we stopped. I'm not trying to diss the space program, but NASA has been underfunded for decades and commercial space travel offers some serious potential.

>The spaceX pricing seems competitive until you realize it will be surpassed by Ariane and ULA around 2022.

Maybe. Of course, SpaceX has its own programs in development so who knows where the prices will be in 4 years. If ULA manages to launch to LEO more reliably and more cheaply than SpaceX then I'll cheer for them, too. I'm on the side of _doing more awesome stuff in space_ and right now SpaceX is where that's happening. A few years ago it was Virgin Galactic, but they've been pretty heavily eclipsed. Still, they've started doing test flights again and they did their first powered flight since the accident a couple of weeks ago and it looks like it went well!

>He rode to school in a rolls royce his family drips with Apartheid money and emerald mines. His brother is currently running a SCAM where he takes 5 million dollars of peoples money, then pretends he built gardens that have already been constructed in detroit. He will pocket that money.

Why do you (or should I) care how he got to school? His father profited off of the system of oppression and exploitation in South Africa under apartheid but that's no mark against Musk's character. I looked up the emerald thing and I was a bit surprised to find you were right. I mean, it's exaggerated (his father owned a half stake in an emerald mine, it looks like?). In any case, it looks like [Elon's dad is a bit insane](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/errol-musk-elon-musk-stepdaughter_us_5ab9113ee4b0decad04c68c3) and he has since cut ties. This is interesting, but again is no mark against the man himself.

>His brother is currently running a SCAM where he takes 5 million dollars of peoples money, then pretends he built gardens that have already been constructed in detroit.

Once again I must ask for a source. Of course, this isn't a _direct_ mark against Elon. But if he is letting his brother use his fame and prestige to scam people then I would count that as a mark against his character. I'm not just going to take your word for it, though.

>They have a taxi to LEO. They haven't really accomplished anything new.

They were the first company to launch, land, and reuse an orbital rocket. That is a thing that happened and nobody else had ever done that before.

I think you know what I'm going to ask for. I'll give you a hint: it starts with an 'e'.

Just to recap, you claimed Elon Musk is an evil liar based on: he's rich, things you say he said that you say are wrong, things you say his brother did, things you say his father did, your possibly willful misunderstanding of the difference between commercial and governmental space programs, your possibly willful misunderstanding of the difference between suborbital and orbital flight, your possibly willful misunderstanding of the difference between the _Earth_ and the _Moon_, and the first link you've given me to an outside source this whole argument: your sneer club of choice.

>I've provided outside references to every single claim I've made

Your claim is meaningless to me. You claim he is an engineer because an organization whom you respect has deemed him to be an honorary engineer.

1. I don't care about titles or diplomas, although I brag about my wifes Ph.D every day. But a Ph.D. is a sign that you added knowledge to the human knowledge base. And published it.
An honorary degree does not. It's a lame argument. He could have paid for a library of something and they gave him the degree. Happens all the time at the University of Alabama, rich dude donates to football team or whatever... his kid gets the great grades the good Fraternity, the good job connections the future employment that you and I will never have etc.... 
He is not an engineer. No engineering degree that is not honorary.

2. That about covers that.

>You don't know how I will respond if you give me evidence because you haven't done that yet

So, I have a story inside my head. My self narrative, my internal voice. the way I view the world. The way I construct things in my mind.  In my mental construct Elon Musk is an evil con artist who lies daily and freely and does not give one single fuck about the environment. He is obsessed with money, power, fame, and the puss. 
I want to explain where my emotional anger comes from.
If I am correct about Elon then the current climate castes the planet earth as Elon's oyster. To do with as he wishes because nobody will stop him. This is a death sentence for the poor people in ways we can not yet realize.

**I do not know how to take my mental construct out of my head and give it to you, or quote on demand citations from it**

I will try to remember key evidences that point elon musk in a bad light but I am sorry that is all I can do. I am limited in that way.

You have to make the mental leap in your own mind after seeing anecdotal evidences over and over again until it just clicks *elon is perhaps a sociopath*.

The good news is that he has created a false biography that says he is really smart and he seems to be not only extremely dumb but decidedly and remarkably predictable.

>The world does not work that way. Christians have zero evidence. Pay zero taxes. same with muslims and jews and others. Lot of bullshit out there.

Well, if you're holding your breath for people to start being rational and using evidence then you will pass out many times over. But just because lots of people are irrational and refuse to accept evidence does not mean I am one of them.

>So, I have a story inside my head.

See, this is the main reason I've continued to argue with you, because I try to subject myself to outside views to decrease the likelihood that I'm catastrophically wrong about something. There is a really good chance that the first person to successfully commercialize space travel will be the world's first trillionaire and it looks like Musk is eyeing that spot for himself.

I have seen Musk support policies that I support, like [AI Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_on_Artificial_Intelligence), [UBI](http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-universal-basic-income-2017-2), renewable energy, and space travel as a way to [hedge against existential risk](https://io9.gizmodo.com/elon-musk-humans-need-to-be-a-multiplanet-species-1698324234). These things make me inclined to support him. But as you point out, if he is simply an amoral individual selfishly maximizing his own power then he is a _huge_ risk for the species and we should absolutely try to raise awareness about it.

I really care about _actually getting the right answer_ here. I think that there are reasons why someone trying to save the human race might cut corners ethically and that sort of utilitarian logic is something I support, but it's also easy to imagine someone might use the _guise_ of trying to save the human race to cover ethical shortcuts and make excuses.

So, lets examine your evidence.

>https://electrek.co/2018/03/24/tesla-car-shipments-dangerous-norway-transporter-crash/

I think the more worrying part of this story is not that the trucks were polluting (sometimes you have to deliver with what you have), but that they cut corners with the safety of their drivers. I'm not sure if the fault lies with Musk in particular or with his subordinates.

>""I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity ""

How is this bullshit? I mean, obviously the ideal thing would not be to push the logistics network so hard in the first place but this seems like the appropriate response. Scale things down to more manageable levels. What would your response have been?

>https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/why-selling-full-self-driving-before-its-ready-could-backfire-for-tesla/

Yup. That's a problem. This is something he does pretty reliably with SpaceX and Tesla: sell something that isn't working or even fully in development yet to raise capital for its development. This isn't like with venture capital where your investors are getting into a known situation with clear disclosure laws outlining legal liabilities.

So far, he tends to deliver... eventually. Almost always he blows past the deadlines he set. This isn't a problem unique to Musk by any means. It plagues the entire tech sector. His track record so far has been alright. Dragon and the Model S did both start delivering eventually. Still, though, the ease with which he's able to sell something he has yet to make bothers me.

>He got the money. Then he cancelled it. This is elon musk's secret. He chases govt money, gets it, then ADHD's his way to something else.

It took me a little while to piece together your argument. If I were you I would go have gone with this [Watchdog article](https://www.watchdog.org/california/tesla-got-m-in-subsidies-for-technology-it-didn-t/article_16c9814c-8176-5a03-a595-8cf0e2119455.html), which lays out the case against Tesla pretty nicely.

Now, there _are_ extenuating circumstances that you didn't mention. Mainly that the battery swap station was [really unpopular](http://fortune.com/2015/06/10/teslas-battery-swap-is-dead/). It makes sense that Tesla would kill the program, but they _also_ took the nearly 300 million dollars in tax credits that were supposed to support that program.

Honestly I think this is the strongest case you've got against Musk (or, Tesla, at least). I can't imagine that one pilot station cost $300M to to run. Which is... confusing, frankly. The program wound up revoking the tax credits when they discovered that the pilot station was no longer operational, so Tesla _lost_ money by closing it, even if no one was actually using it.

This is a weird situation, but not one that falls in Musk's favor.

>https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/01/teslas-solarcity-buyout-looking-worse-by-the-day.aspx

I'm waiting a couple of years to reserve final judgement on the Tesla acquisition of Solarcity. Musk says that he has amazing plans for synergy, I guess we'll see. But whatever those plans are, they are not apparent right now so I think the null hypothesis has to be that it was a bailout in disguise. Not totally abnormal behavior, but definitely unethical and probably illegal. I hope Musk proves this null hypothesis wrong, but he hasn't yet.

>What one empirical evidence would convince you?

Ha ha, well if you had a video of Musk ranting about how he was going to take over the world while kicking puppies maybe...

But in all seriousness, I think you raise some valid points. I don't think the correct response to these points is to think that Musk is Literally Satan, but I _do_ think the correct response is to watch him _very closely_.

If he cares about the things he _says_ he cares about then I could accept this behavior and view him as a conflicted but important figure. Like Thomas Jefferson or Wernher von Braun (and, honestly, even if he _is_ defrauding his investors and the State of California that doesn't rank as low in my book as building rockets for Nazis or owning people).

SpaceX _has_, after all, done some pretty amazing things and if the BFR works (even behind schedule) it could be a game-changer.

With all of this in mind, I am going to pay very close attention to a few things: the Solarcity acquisition (if it turns out it _was_ merely a ploy then this sort of deceptive behavior does not bode well), worker rights at his factories (still the main thing the bothers me about him), and above all, any sign that his stated goals of making humanity a multiplanetary species and ensuring that automation does not create a slave-caste of humanity are calculated lies to win over the public.

I'm guessing that you sent me the worst stuff you can find, but if you have any more evidence that strengthens your earlier points or touches on the last of the concerns I mentioned then I will read over it with as much impartiality as I can muster.

I still think you're biased against Musk and should try to temper your beliefs, but if you can try to come off as less incoherent and lead with your evidence I think you'll do better against Musk fanboys. While I disagree with large parts of your position, I think that throwing some cold water on the cult of personality Musk has attracted is an important mission. 

Whether he's secretly evil or not it doesn't do any good to pretend the man can do no harm. So much of his coverage in media is _unquestioningly_ positive.

>But if you refuse to commit to that, then that means you have to admit he has some other sources of income or wealth, which could be used to fund TBC. So which is it? So far you've denied both, which seems logically inconsistent to me.

We know TBC has no money, so he's not making anything from it.  And we know that he was almost broke before Tesla got its funding lifeline way back in the early days because he sunk all his money into SpaceX and Tesla.  That means all his wealth is pretty much tied up in SpaceX and Tesla.

So, generally speaking, investment banks will loan money out against private company stock, however, they generally try to limit their risk \(lend less, etc\) since there is no public market for them to sell the stock.  We also know Elon was a buyer of SpaceX stock on the last funding round so he's not taking out loans against that stock since he's already using loaned money to buy it.  We also agree\(?\) that his previous Tesla stock sales were to satisfy tax obligations.  And he takes a token salary.  This means that he has 2 possible sources of money for TBCs funding: loans against Tesla stock and loans against SpaceX stock.

We know he has 624M in Tesla loans.  That's against a $50B company.  If he took loans against SpaceX stock the amount would be lower for two primary reasons: 1\) illiquid market for the stock and 2\) lower market cap \(less to loan against\).  For the sake of argument let's say he took the same tried to take the same percentage of loans/market cap.  That means his spacex loan at the time of their July 2017 funding would be around 250M.  But the terms of that loan would have been more restrictive.  Even pink sheet stocks tend to have drastically lower margin terms so let's say they give  him 50&#37; \(which is high, but again erring on the side of caution\) that means he has $125M in SpaceX loans.

So his total loans are around $750M of which he put $100M \(a fairly large portion\) into TBC.

So what did my original post say:

>Elon has personal loans that use his shares in Tesla as collateral. He uses a fairly large portion of this money to fund TBC. Now TBC is buying parts from Tesla. Interesting.

I would suggest that 100M of a total of 750M in loans is a fairly large portion and that since Tesla loans make up the majority of his outstanding loans, this post is still accurate.  But I'm sure you'll find some place where I missed a period or didn't capitalize and then expand that into why I'm wrong, but have at it.

Finally, I would point out that there is little reason for him to take a loan out against SpaceX when the Tesla loan terms would be so much more favorable \(cheaper\).  So odds are this is all Tesla loan money.",dy2z7vh,1524892103,4/28/2018,spacex,April-2018

Okay, so have I. I say that Musk is an engineer and I have given you some of my evidence for believing that. You have stubbornly declared that he isn't and when pressed for evidence you give me nothing. Do you often win arguments this way?

>Waiting for the vote ron paul speech...

I don't think your model of me is a good as you think it is, but I honestly don't care.

Buddy, I already told you. I don't do the whole 'hero worship' thing. I am _very_ good at calibration: my beliefs match the evidence I see. If you want to win this argument then being cynical and biting isn't going to help. The only thing that will sway me is _actual fucking evidence_.

A brief look at your history shows that you're a frequent 'contributor' to r/EnoughMuskSpam/ which makes me suspect that it is not me, but rather you, who is gravely biased on this account.

If you want to show that Musk is not the groundbreaking visionary he looks like, then you need to provide _evidence_ that he is not an engineer or otherwise not really the driving force behind the innovations made in self-driving technology, aerospace, electric vehicles, battery storage, ecommerce, and... drilling, I guess? (I'll admit that the 'Boring Company' seems like a mostly pointless idea) Anyway, Musk spearheaded efforts in all of those areas and both he and people who work at his companies claim he is a core part of the actual technical work they do.

And I'll just go ahead a say that it will not be enough to simply show that Musk is overblown in his media exposure. _Of course_ he is. That's what media _does_, they blow things up larger than life.

>And tesla is a ponzi scheme.

Again, no evidence. Ponzi scheme means something specific, not just ""thing I don't like"".

>And spacex does not deserve the cult religion it has.

Now here I actually kinda agree with you. While 'cult' is a very specific word that only an idiot would think literally applies here, SpaceX, Tesla, and Musk in particular attract a lot of worship and adulation. I worry that this shields them from legitimate criticisms that can be made about their business practices and I don't like it when people are incapable of thinking for themselves. 

That being said, it is possible to like someone and like the things they do _without_ worshiping them. I mean, fuck, my heroes are people like Richard Feynman and Isaac Newton. Feynman had troubling views about women and Newton spent the last decade of his life chasing after the occult. I love Ender's Game but Scott Card is a homophobic asshole.

>Leave the cult man.

I'm not in the cult of loving Elon Musk, dude. You're in the cult of hating him. You're the exact sort of person that becomes an anti-vaxxer or a moon landing denialist. You don't respect evidence or rational argument and are incapable of nuance. Any thought that might threaten your worldview makes you react with anger and defensiveness.

I am perfectly able to imagine the world in which Elon Musk is _exactly_ who you think he is. I can imagine one day discovering that he's been faking his technical knowledge in interviews and has been brutally pressing everyone beneath him to work far harder than is healthy in order to achieve the amazing things SpaceX has achieved. Imagining this makes me sad, but I do not resist the possibility. If Elon Musk is an evil liar then I want to believe that he is an evil liar. If Elon Musk is a genius visionary then I want to believe that he is a genius visionary.

There are a lot of cases where firms recognize revenues in interesting ways to go around this; one of them being to sell themselves their own goods. Krispy Creme was in trouble because they overestimated demand, so they expanded to quickly (this is from memory so I could be wrong on some details). Basically they recorded revenues for sales of equipment to franchises, but they were really selling them to themselves. It was found out, and they got in trouble. Again off the top of my head, there was another company called Satyam (which means truth in sanskrit) the company started with really great intentions, but got into financial trouble and felt they should falsely recognize revenues to keep the business afloat. The owner created a second company called Maytas and they began sharing funds, and wrongly recording revenues.

I am not inclined to worship and I don't take heroes easily. I am certainly a fan of Musk, but I don't think I suffer under particularly strong bias. I think there are [legitimate criticisms](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243436/tesla-factory-worker-injuries-union-uaw) to be made when it comes to how he treats his workers, especially the blue collar workers in Tesla's factories. I also think that his line on AI, while mostly correct, is a bit simplistic; he often alludes to the Terminator and other AI-apocalypse stories which I think put the wrong imagine in peoples minds about the exact threat AI poses.

I have no idea where you're getting your information from and I would love to see your sources. It wouldn't surprise me all that much, though. And, frankly, I don't really _care_ all that much. Plenty of rich kids had good computers in the '70s and '80s. Far few eventually built tech empires.

>Elon musk is not an engineer. Elon musk does not design jack crap.

Are you expecting me to just take your word for it? There are many instances where he has publicly demonstrated his knowledge of the things he works with. Without too much Googling I [found a story](http://qr.ae/TU1DMI) from someone who claims they were contacted by Musk out of the blue asking technical questions about a material they were an expert on.

So let me ask you: why do you believe what you believe? What do you think you know and how do you think you know it?

>Billionaires are not a good thing. In order for one to exist millions must be in poverty. Working.

Maybe. This is a complicated issue that is far beyond the scope of this discussion. Mind you, it is clear from the way you said ""millions must be in poverty"" that your understanding of economics is about as good as your understanding of AI. All I will do on this point is observe that your very first shot in this argument was to name two aerospace billionaires and complain that they were not as well known as Musk.

Okay, so have I. I say that Musk is an engineer and I have given you some of my evidence for believing that. You have stubbornly declared that he isn't and when pressed for evidence you give me nothing. Do you often win arguments this way?

""Empirical"" is not a magic word that makes arguments go away. You have to actually provide evidence to be able to say you're demonstrating something empirically.

Buddy, I already told you. I don't do the whole 'hero worship' thing. I am _very_ good at calibration: my beliefs match the evidence I see. If you want to win this argument then being cynical and biting isn't going to help. The only thing that will sway me is _actual fucking evidence_.

A brief look at your history shows that you're a frequent 'contributor' to r/EnoughMuskSpam/ which makes me suspect that it is not me, but rather you, who is gravely biased on this account.

If you want to show that Musk is not the groundbreaking visionary he looks like, then you need to provide _evidence_ that he is not an engineer or otherwise not really the driving force behind the innovations made in self-driving technology, aerospace, electric vehicles, battery storage, ecommerce, and... drilling, I guess? (I'll admit that the 'Boring Company' seems like a mostly pointless idea) Anyway, Musk spearheaded efforts in all of those areas and both he and people who work at his companies claim he is a core part of the actual technical work they do.

And I'll just go ahead a say that it will not be enough to simply show that Musk is overblown in his media exposure. _Of course_ he is. That's what media _does_, they blow things up larger than life. But that isn't evidence against the work he's done.",dxickeg,1524002265,4/17/2018,tesla,April-2018

>And tesla is a ponzi scheme.

Again, no evidence. Ponzi scheme means something specific, not just ""thing I don't like"".

>And spacex does not deserve the cult religion it has.

Now here I actually kinda agree with you. While 'cult' is a very specific word that only an idiot would think literally applies here, SpaceX, Tesla, and Musk in particular attract a lot of worship and adulation. I worry that this shields them from legitimate criticisms that can be made about their business practices and I don't like it when people are incapable of thinking for themselves. 

That being said, it is possible to like someone and like the things they do _without_ worshiping them. I mean, fuck, my heroes are people like Richard Feynman and Isaac Newton. Feynman had troubling views about women and Newton spent the last decade of his life chasing after the occult. I love Ender's Game but Scott Card is a homophobic asshole.

>Leave the cult man.

I'm not in the cult of loving Elon Musk, dude. You're in the cult of hating him. You're the exact sort of person that becomes an anti-vaxxer or a moon landing denialist. You don't respect evidence or rational argument and are incapable of nuance. Any thought that might threaten your worldview makes you react with anger and defensiveness.

I am perfectly able to imagine the world in which Elon Musk is _exactly_ who you think he is. I can imagine one day discovering that he's been faking his technical knowledge in interviews and has been brutally pressing everyone beneath him to work far harder than is healthy in order to achieve the amazing things SpaceX has achieved. Imagining this makes me sad, but I do not resist the possibility. If Elon Musk is an evil liar then I want to believe that he is an evil liar. If Elon Musk is a genius visionary then I want to believe that he is a genius visionary.

The failure in this conversation has been yours to provide evidence for the things you claim. I offer you the rare opportunity to actually change someone's mind over the Internet and all you have to do is defend your beliefs.

An honorary degree does not. It's a lame argument. He could have paid for a library of something and they gave him the degree. Happens all the time at the University of Alabama, rich dude donates to football team or whatever... his kid gets the great grades the good Fraternity, the good job connections the future employment that you and I will never have etc....

>The world does not work that way. Christians have zero evidence. Pay zero taxes. same with muslims and jews and others. Lot of bullshit out there.

Well, if you're holding your breath for people to start being rational and using evidence then you will pass out many times over. But just because lots of people are irrational and refuse to accept evidence does not mean I am one of them.

>So, I have a story inside my head.

See, this is the main reason I've continued to argue with you, because I try to subject myself to outside views to decrease the likelihood that I'm catastrophically wrong about something. There is a really good chance that the first person to successfully commercialize space travel will be the world's first trillionaire and it looks like Musk is eyeing that spot for himself.

I have seen Musk support policies that I support, like [AI Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_on_Artificial_Intelligence), [UBI](http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-universal-basic-income-2017-2), renewable energy, and space travel as a way to [hedge against existential risk](https://io9.gizmodo.com/elon-musk-humans-need-to-be-a-multiplanet-species-1698324234). These things make me inclined to support him. But as you point out, if he is simply an amoral individual selfishly maximizing his own power then he is a _huge_ risk for the species and we should absolutely try to raise awareness about it.

I really care about _actually getting the right answer_ here. I think that there are reasons why someone trying to save the human race might cut corners ethically and that sort of utilitarian logic is something I support, but it's also easy to imagine someone might use the _guise_ of trying to save the human race to cover ethical shortcuts and make excuses.

So, lets examine your evidence.

>https://electrek.co/2018/03/24/tesla-car-shipments-dangerous-norway-transporter-crash/

I think the more worrying part of this story is not that the trucks were polluting (sometimes you have to deliver with what you have), but that they cut corners with the safety of their drivers. I'm not sure if the fault lies with Musk in particular or with his subordinates.

>""I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity ""

How is this bullshit? I mean, obviously the ideal thing would not be to push the logistics network so hard in the first place but this seems like the appropriate response. Scale things down to more manageable levels. What would your response have been?

>https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/why-selling-full-self-driving-before-its-ready-could-backfire-for-tesla/

Yup. That's a problem. This is something he does pretty reliably with SpaceX and Tesla: sell something that isn't working or even fully in development yet to raise capital for its development. This isn't like with venture capital where your investors are getting into a known situation with clear disclosure laws outlining legal liabilities.

So far, he tends to deliver... eventually. Almost always he blows past the deadlines he set. This isn't a problem unique to Musk by any means. It plagues the entire tech sector. His track record so far has been alright. Dragon and the Model S did both start delivering eventually. Still, though, the ease with which he's able to sell something he has yet to make bothers me.

>He got the money. Then he cancelled it. This is elon musk's secret. He chases govt money, gets it, then ADHD's his way to something else.

It took me a little while to piece together your argument. If I were you I would go have gone with this [Watchdog article](https://www.watchdog.org/california/tesla-got-m-in-subsidies-for-technology-it-didn-t/article_16c9814c-8176-5a03-a595-8cf0e2119455.html), which lays out the case against Tesla pretty nicely.

Now, there _are_ extenuating circumstances that you didn't mention. Mainly that the battery swap station was [really unpopular](http://fortune.com/2015/06/10/teslas-battery-swap-is-dead/). It makes sense that Tesla would kill the program, but they _also_ took the nearly 300 million dollars in tax credits that were supposed to support that program.

Honestly I think this is the strongest case you've got against Musk (or, Tesla, at least). I can't imagine that one pilot station cost $300M to to run. Which is... confusing, frankly. The program wound up revoking the tax credits when they discovered that the pilot station was no longer operational, so Tesla _lost_ money by closing it, even if no one was actually using it.

This is a weird situation, but not one that falls in Musk's favor.

>https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/01/teslas-solarcity-buyout-looking-worse-by-the-day.aspx

I'm waiting a couple of years to reserve final judgement on the Tesla acquisition of Solarcity. Musk says that he has amazing plans for synergy, I guess we'll see. But whatever those plans are, they are not apparent right now so I think the null hypothesis has to be that it was a bailout in disguise. Not totally abnormal behavior, but definitely unethical and probably illegal. I hope Musk proves this null hypothesis wrong, but he hasn't yet.

>What one empirical evidence would convince you?

Ha ha, well if you had a video of Musk ranting about how he was going to take over the world while kicking puppies maybe...

But in all seriousness, I think you raise some valid points. I don't think the correct response to these points is to think that Musk is Literally Satan, but I _do_ think the correct response is to watch him _very closely_.

If he cares about the things he _says_ he cares about then I could accept this behavior and view him as a conflicted but important figure. Like Thomas Jefferson or Wernher von Braun (and, honestly, even if he _is_ defrauding his investors and the State of California that doesn't rank as low in my book as building rockets for Nazis or owning people).

SpaceX _has_, after all, done some pretty amazing things and if the BFR works (even behind schedule) it could be a game-changer.

With all of this in mind, I am going to pay very close attention to a few things: the Solarcity acquisition (if it turns out it _was_ merely a ploy then this sort of deceptive behavior does not bode well), worker rights at his factories (still the main thing the bothers me about him), and above all, any sign that his stated goals of making humanity a multiplanetary species and ensuring that automation does not create a slave-caste of humanity are calculated lies to win over the public.

I'm guessing that you sent me the worst stuff you can find, but if you have any more evidence that strengthens your earlier points or touches on the last of the concerns I mentioned then I will read over it with as much impartiality as I can muster.

I still think you're biased against Musk and should try to temper your beliefs, but if you can try to come off as less incoherent and lead with your evidence I think you'll do better against Musk fanboys. While I disagree with large parts of your position, I think that throwing some cold water on the cult of personality Musk has attracted is an important mission. 

Whether he's secretly evil or not it doesn't do any good to pretend the man can do no harm. So much of his coverage in media is _unquestioningly_ positive.

It's an impressive company in that his cult fanbase who is so enamored with him will buy anything for a ton more than it costs as long as it has a Boring Company label on it. That flamethrower apparently cost like $200 and he sold it for $500 with a Boring Co label on it. He's talking about candy and he'll probably do the same thing - sell crap with a Boring Company label on it for a premium price and his fanbase will fall all over themselves.

I've compared it to Jackie on the old Howard Stern show milking his fanbase for every last cent and Boring Company is Elon's Silicon Valley version of Jokeland - it's all about sellin' that merch. Elon is smart and realizes that cult of his will buy any crap he can sell them cause they all think he's gonna save the world. Or better yet, Elon's a bit of this, especially with Boring/Hyperloop: http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Lyle_Lanley

If Boring Company is so fantastically innovative, why does nobody want to invest? https://nypost.com/2018/04/17/elon-musks-tunnel-digging-startup-raises-another-112-5-million/ 90% of the recent fund raise came from Musk, the rest employees. Outside investor interest? 0.

 He's BSing about how he's sleeping on the couch and in production hell, but Buffett says one thing about candy and all the sudden Elon has tons of time to play Wonka? He's doing it because he's super focused on merch he can sell that fanbase.

I'm not going to even get into the shareholder lawsuit, which outlines in great detail about how Tesla execs knew they would never meet the numbers they were telling investors.

Also, he bailed Solar City out. His cousins who started the business have already moved on. The lawsuit over Tesla's purchase of that is going to be even more interesting to watch than Elon's bizarre recent behavior.

So will everyone else.  Acting like the competitors won't stabilize is silly.  If stability is the only thing keeping ULA going, then they will be gone in 5 years when everyone else that is cheaper is also stable.

They are going to bank entirely on the pentagon paying for two launch providers even when they are significantly more expensive.  If anyone else enters that market, then this ""plan"" will fail.  If someone at the pentagon wises up and realizes its not work the price to have two providers, then they will fail.

221,23051,8havi3,"Thanks for the superb response. This is the content I look forward to on /r/RealTesla . 

> In general, I don't buy the idea that any one man can really, truly be what the Musk legend portrays him to be. The older I get, the more I realized people are a lot more alike than they are different, and the people I saw as heroes and villains in my younger years both became a little more human and normal when looked at through a more mature set of eyes. Shit, look at Bill Cosby - until a couple years ago, he was a pillar of the community, a universally respected man who achieved more than 99% of his peers... and now...sleepy rapist.

I too am starting to experience this as I get older. This increasing pessimism I think comes naturally to many people as they see how the world really works. There are a lot of Tesla fanboys who are quite young and see Musk can do no wrong. Hell many of them are probably the people spending all day on /r/Teslamotors and viciously attack anyone who dares to challenge their idol. With that being said, I feel that you should read the book, or even listen to the audiobook(the audio book is narrated well). 

The biography paints a picture of a deeply flawed man who regularly hurts the people close to him and causes tremendous agony to his employees. It is through the individual stories that you begin to see both the good and the bad sides of Musk. I wonder how much of Musk's recent popularity and subsequently Tesla's recent survival was due to this 2015 biography? The stock is propped up on people's belief in him right? 

There is no doubt that Musk still has a high chance of failing. It is just that the upbringing explained in his biography is so *different* from other biographies of successful people like Steve Jobs or Barack Obama for example. Everything the fanboys believe hinges upon the idea that Musk's head *is* somehow wired up differently and that allows him to succeed in the environment silicon valley has created. 

>So on the surface I reject the idea that Musk is some superhuman, omniscient, master of everything. Just... no. No one is. No one should be receiving the kind of adulation he does; it speaks more to the people doing the worshiping (they need a hero) than the man himself.

You hit the nail on the head. I too fall in this camp from time to time. I admire the hard work he seems to be able to put his employees through. At least in the case of SpaceX, it is hard to ignore that he is doing something amazing. Likewise, it sets up a false impression that if I just work harder I can be like Musk. Sure, I'm sure most people (including me) can push ourselves harder, but it is important to understand the tradeoffs of this approach. We are not guaranteed to end up like Musk. 

>Besides, if anyone does deserve that kind of reverence, it's not a businessman who spends his life flying his private jet from one press appearance to another. An oncology nurse, or a social worker in an impoverished area, maybe. People who give their life to the betterment of society for little pay and even less recognition. But I digress....

I'd argue that people like Doctors, nurses, and people who generally improve the world do get respect, just maybe not enough. There are people out there that need something or someone to aspire to and with the decline of religion, I feel that maybe these Musk like figures are sort of taking that place. 

> Now, where does self-promotion end and altruism start? That's the interesting question. Is he truly trying to ""save humanity"", or just trying to stay in the spotlight as long as possible, and smart enough to know that his key to staying there is playing the part of someone trying to save humanity. I know that sounds cynical, but I've yet to have someone make a meaningful argument as to why Musk needs to always be in front of the camera talking about what he's doing. 

This I'd argue is one of his deep flaws and it could be his undoing. In the biography they interview JB Straubel who is Tesla's Chief Technology Officer. He is described as having to learn the hard way to check his ego at the door. He explained that Elon has a serious Ego problem in that he has to be the center of attention, potentially springing from his upbringing of being bullied and treated very poorly by his father. JB explained that he had a choice, either push back and demand the spotlight for which he deserved, or check his ego at the door and let Elon have the public admiration so he does not risk losing his chance at achieving his life goals. This story played out differently at SpaceX where some of the early engineers butted heads with Elon and had to leave the company. 

>Finally, let's talk about ""brilliance"". Brilliance is knowing when you're not an expert, and letting an expert make the decisions for you. Brilliance is knowing when you add to the situation, and when you're detracting from it - it's acknowledging that you're not perfect, and playing to your strengths accordingly.

Agree wholeheartedly. This is what placed doubt in my mind about Elon early on. In the book some engineers give anecdotes about how Elon would grill the Engineers about how a particular type of welding works or how something is done in industry. The engineers explain that what initially appears to be Musk testing them if they knew their stuff turned out to be Musk wanting to learn as much as he possibly could about a particular topic and then allow engineers to choose the best path forward with him. Obviously this strategy seems broken or non-existent at Tesla. I don't have an answer to this. We need more verified details about what is really going on at Tesla. 

>I admire what he's doing with SpaceX, but again I don't know that it's ""brilliant"" - it's certainly admirable and interesting to throw a fuckton of money at those projects to make them happen, but I guess that's what I see it as : having the guts and resolve to spend money on things that no one else has.

The only lasting comment I have to say about SpaceX is that we can clearly see the difference between a company that pushes its employees to the breaking point([spacex](https://youtu.be/A0FZIwabctw?t=55)) vs a company that is easier on its employees([blue origin](https://youtu.be/HuKGJRmIjGU?t=459)).

Not true, they would have moved much slower under someone else.  So you have no idea where they would be right now.

This article is interesting since before this major production-line labor issue, he's built his companies with this exact attitude. 

I'm in a pretty relevant field and local to a few of his campuses, so I have a fair amount of friends who've ended up filtering in/out of Elon's companies over the years.  


From what I can tell, the majority of *engineers* who work at Tesla sign up because they're Musk fanboys in the first place. It makes sense when you consider that the positions are highly sought after, have mediocre pay, and have an established reputation for having unreasonably high expectations. SpaceX is the same way. You join because you want to go to Mars, and because of that there's an implicit understanding that you'll be overworked, underpaid, and micromanaged. SpaceX is (was?) so bad about micromanaging that two low to mid level engineers I know who work there claim that they're in direct contact with Elon on a semi-regular basis. While my reaction was ""that sounds inefficient"", they wear that like a badge of honor. I swear it's like a cult for some people. 



But now that Elon has to deal with a blue-collared labor force, he can't just fill his payroll with people willing to sacrifice their time and effort just to help him chase his dreams. There's going to need to be a culture shift or a pay increase for his factory workers, either of which will likely result in a culture shift or pay increase for his engineering staff.

For your information, a small number of FCVs on the road will make local production at gas stations profitable. The capital costs are actually quite low especially since it will be amortized over the many decade lifetime of the gas station. 


Hydrogen at the pump will be cheaper than charging your car after work (peak hours) because electrolysis is going to be done using off-peak electricity. 

Well-to-wheel efficiency of FCVs is actually on par with using the grid to charge your car. But that doesn’t matter because a 5L tank of hydrogen weighing 200lbs provides 700 miles of range, which is more than double what you get from a the latest LiOn battery packs which weigh 1200lbs and take up ~200L of space. Because Hydrogen has 5-10x the volumetric & gravimetric energy density  of LiOn batteries, FCVs can be half as  efficient as BEVs and still be the superior option. And refueling takes 5 minutes, vastly superior to using batteries.

Exactly the type of thing he combated with common sense.   No one felt smaller tunnels would be useful, musk simply said ""Why can't they be useful?""

Turns out you can move lots of people and cars very fast using small tunnels.  A subway car is in a huge tunnel for no reason, why shouldn't the tunnel be no bigger than the subway car?

They can move way more people even if the cars hold less people because they travel so much faster.  I believe the figure they had is 2000 people an hour.  The beauty is the offloading and loading sections are separate from the fast main track, so they can send a stream of cars through and have unloading and loading areas in different places of the airport.  The more unloading and loading areas, the more cars per hour they can get through the tube.  No car blocks any other car.

Also with your example if 5 planes land with 200 people each it will take them an hour to get to downtown , which is painfully slow with most waiting in line single file to get on a car . 


The only advantage of musks plan is distributed loading stations ( which doesn’t sound like it’s the case for this project as they mentioned they will reuse an old station ) , and potentially cost . 

Building many smaller tunes to equal the capacity of a bigger tunnel should be about the same in terms of cost. You will need more electric cars and more tunnels dug . 

The big advantage with electric skates is no high power voltage transmission lines to follow the trains and cost advantage of building the skates with Tesla’s battery tech and expertise .  But when you have risks like fire from the battery , automation / control system failure , servicing etc . And to certify all this new automation is gonna take years.

What a crock of shit. Get injured and you move to a new job with increased earning each time? That's some of the biggest bullshit i've ever read.

Comparing your startup which was in a niche field that did something that hadn't ever been done before to any of Elon's company's is ridiculous.  He's trying to enter into industries that are already being dominated and impact so many other industries.  Additionally, most start ups that are actually trying to fundamentally change infrastructure of a country, require a different amount of effort than a niche company doing something brand new. 

There's plenty of people who think what they're doing and the goal they're working for is more important than their free time or the amount of money they make.  I don't agree with that outlook, but there are people who accept that. They're not wrong, it's just a perspective.

I'm defending the construction of the sub and saying we shouldn't shame him for trying which was in reference to the comment I was replying to. I'm not an Elon cultist, fuck that guy. I find him to be an insufferable douche and the way he handled this whole thing, especially his Twitter meltdown, was very bad.

That being said no I did not ""literally lie"". I meant the sub wasn't going to necessarily shuttle all of them through the entire length of the tunnel but for certain parts of the operation it could help. I admit I could've been more clear with my words, but I was at work and didn't expect the comments to be picked apart.  And yes there is stuff to work on, like maybe finding ways to slim it down and make it more maneuverable? No it didn't work out, and he didn't make the perfect sub in time to save the day but he was being requesting by Richard Scranton, who was one of the divers leading the rescue mission, to keep working on it.

In the emails they stated """"We're worried about the smallest lad PLEASE keep working on the capsule details"" They literally asked him to keeping working on it. So if Richard thinks there's something to work on, and the engineers were literally working on ways to slim down and turn the corners, who the fuck are you to say there's literally nothing to ""work on""? Now notice he mentioned the ""smallest lad"". Well if the sub needs to be able to take the corners better, seems like with a smaller body in it they can work on making it smaller to better maneuver.

Also Narongsak Osatanakorn, the principal governor, was leading the rescue mission similarly to a governor in the states leads the national guard for natural disasters. Yes they're directing the operation and coordinating rescue efforts, but they're not in the field researching the cave schematics. They're not engineers or divers who have expertise in the subject, they defer to the actual experts. And in this case Richard Scranton, one of the divers, also helped lead the efforts. He was in regular email communication asking him to help. If he abandoned the project and it came out they were asking him for help then people, myself included, would be calling him out.

Him being super public about it and arrogant was definitely a PR stunt, and you're right that he's gotten himself a cult, but defending the construction of the sub doesn't make someone one of his cultists. I think it was great that the sub was attempted, and it's a pretty cool concept that can come in handy in the future whether in Thailand or wherever.

Again, not attacked. Literally your whole comment is based on being apologistic for Musk for no good reason. He was not attacked, he did not actually effectively help. He made a PR move on a tragedy and while not having a central role, tried to move himself into that role. He got called out, and before Unsworth tried to discredit others who were actual part of the rescue because they criticized the sub not being practical for this case. Then Unsworth, who was the one to actually map out the cave and personally request professional divers to come and help with the rescue before anything of it went viral, called Musk out on it. Yea, he told him to stick it up where it hurts. To call this an attack is some exaggeration. 

Even if you go as far and call it an attack, even if Musks allegation was true - what does it have to do with the submarine? It's crazy that anyone thinks a personal attack by Musk as a response would be an acceptable reaction. It is not. 

Now, with calling him a pedo, he basically insulted the entire nation and all of the tourists that go there. It's a ridiculously huge PR shitstain he smeared over himself.

He was a hero before, he just had no need to create PR for himself like Musk. You didn't even know his name before Musk insulted him.

No, I can attest that you are on full on apology mode for your hero, while he himself has deleted the tweets and run for the hills. In doing so, you also repeatedly attack the actual rescuers.

Rightly so.

You admit you have no clue what that tweet was or where in the timeline it occurred, but you are sure Musk was absolutely right. That is beyond fanboy into fetishism.

Stanton was perfectly polite to him in emails, until he turned up with a PR circus and insulted the team.

The emails Musk published certainly didn't sound like that. More like ""Yeah please keep going we can use any help we get"". And Musk didn't think it was not needed, he was worried if they still needed to do changes to it.

Sure, but they weren't conversing that way since it wasn't fully built yet at first.  As for the final discussion, the images and video were public on twitter, he didn't need to email them.  When stanton told him they were worried about the final kid and for him to keep working, he would have seen the videos on twitter.

>The emails Musk published certainly didn't sound like that. More like ""Yeah please keep going we can use any help we get""

lolwut?  Stanton specifically said they are worried the smallest kid and asked him to keep working on the details of it.  There is no ambiguity there.  He was asked to work on it by the lead diver.  That also makes him part of the rescue effort, the same all the other people working on backup plans that were not used.  You don't get to lie about this.

>Also, Musk said in that very email that he'll send pictures and videos. So.. that never happened?

He posted the videos via tweets for everyone to see.  If stanton didn't look, he was still conversing in text with descriptions of the changes musk was making.  It is hard to believe he didn't look though.  How could he have time to converse about it, but not time to look at a 30sec video?

>Again, all of that needs a source. You can't just make a claim like that, treat is as fact and expect me to believe it.

No.  You need a source that says vern was actively working.  I am going off the tweets and information from last week before vern did the paid interview to smear musk.  The only documented action vern was involved in was giving the note to the government employee that was passed up to officials that told them to contact stanton.

After that, nothing.  Vern didn't even describe helping in the media interview where he attacked musk.  So if you claim he helped, you post proof.  From what I can tell, he was on site, but he was not working in the cave and while outside I just don't see him doing anything special.  If he did something, he would have mentioned it.

He had more knowlege of the sub than any of the divers and likely wasnt really ‘in the loop’ so to speak with the guy in charge there and felt like they gambled those kids lives because they wanted to reject his help.

There is like one source.  Every other news site just copied from eachother.  Which is why so much info is wrong.

Your source is sadly false and misleading.  He gave the thai officials a note and nothing else says he was involved after that.

>It was Unsworth who initially pinpointed where he thought the Wild Boars team would be waiting.

This is horribly misleading.  I didn't connect that dot earlier, but considering vern was the one talking to the media for money(while everyone else refused to talk to them), he clearly is the source of the ""pattaya beach"" location the media was reporting on that ended up being wrong.  https://imgur.com/Unp7JCk.png  See that flooded area called ""pattaya beach""?  That is the area vern said they would be.  He was wrong and if the divers didn't keep going, the boys would not have been found.

>Hell, even if all he did was to get a team of expert divers together that rescued the kids, that's still a hell of a lot more than what Musk did.

The problem there is you don't know if the thai government would have contacted the top cave diver on planet earth without vern.    Remember, we know vern passed them a note, we have no idea what the thai governent was going to do. The note didn't even have contact info on it.  It was just a list of names.  They never said that note was the only reason they contacted stanton.  I think it is reasonable to assume the thai government would have contacted the top cave diver on earth.   Just search ""cave diver rescue"" (filtering out the last month) and you see all the top names that helped on the first page.  Way more names than were on vern's list.

So I am sorry, but vern was talking to the media for money and not involved in the actual rescue operation, I need proof that he truly helped.  The more you look into it, the less it looks like he helped.

**As is often the case, there’s a nuanced story with multiple morals here — one that most news outlets have, for whatever reasons, failed to tell.**

Let’s start with the common narrative, which I think is fairly represented in this tweet (chosen randomly among hundreds like it):

>📷[**rich fitzmaurice**@FitzmauriceRich](https://twitter.com/FitzmauriceRich)Very disappointed in [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) during this Thai episode. Jumped on a PR opportunity, throws his expensive toy out the pram when told it \*so obviously\* wouldn’t work and now disrespecting heroes involved who clearly did a super human feat in rescuing boys.

[Twitter Ads info and privacy](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20175256)

We have a few inter-related claims here:

1. That Musk’s involvement was primarily about PR.
2. That his “expensive toy” was of no value to rescue efforts.
3. That he was disrespectful of rescuers in the plural.

And then, of course, we have Musk’s already-infamous “pedo guy” dig.

We’ll take each of those in turn, using context to determine how fair or unfair each claim might be.

**#1: The massive PR stunt.**

This criticism came in three somewhat contradictory flavors. Some blamed Musk for making too much of his efforts, some blamed him for not making a different contribution, and some blamed him for not solving totally unrelated problems.

To give a few representative examples:

So an engineer hasn’t used his free time to solve a border-control problem that’s outlasted every elected politician and subject-matter expert that’s ever been paid to figure it out? Time for the tar and feathers, I guess.

More to the point, though, one does wonder why Musk was ever vocal about this particular issue in the first place?

Well, as it turns out, we know exactly why.

Note the date. The boys went missing on June 23rd. It had been a national news issue for well over a week at that point — i.e., just long enough for engineering types to begin wondering if perhaps they could do something to help.

As for why Musk thought that open conversations on Twitter were a positive means to that end?

So, in sum, a wealthy problem-solver with a long history of responding to charity requests on Twitter is asked to see what he can do to help. He agrees, opens dialogue for ideas, takes them to the on-the-ground experts for feedback, then sends some of his best engineers to work pro bono on practical mechanics.

And this is a bad thing…?

Youre coming across as unhinged, the expert cave divers agreed it wouldnt work given the dimensions of the cave.



>no, they don't - and i just linked you to email correspondence between elon musk and the lead of the rescue efforts that implored him to continue working on the sub

As a back up, and not imploring you fucking elon musk fan girl.

>if the leader of the rescue effort asks musk to continue working on the sub, that's a strong signal that not all of the ""experts"" agree that it wouldn't work

Given the fact it wasnt used is already evidence that they agreed it would not work and the fact they told him so.

 it was the back up for a back up.

Among many other implausible plans they didnt use but were pursued.

And the leader was a thai governor of chiang rai, he was in contact with a diver

>but i guess dick stanton, the lead diver of the rescue efforts who asked musk to keep working on it, is also in it for PR.

No, he was asked to keep working on it im the event it would become a feasable option given they pursued literally all of them.

It didnt.

Musk wanting to play it as such does suggest wanting pr.

>SURELY knew it wouldn't work

Nobody knew, thats why they asked him.

But what he built we do know wouldnt have worked in these caves at which point musk is trying to reap pr if claiming its the thing they will use despite knowing it wont.

I think he just wants to get people on there and set up the structures to let us properly colonize it... that alone will cement his legacy more then anything else. Think about how we still look back at those who managed to colonize N.A., much more the man who managed to colonize an actual *new world.* 

The thing is, I totally agree; I'd have a lot more respect for him if he treated his workers better; but, at the same time, the man clearly has a goal in mind, and cares *way* more about progress then he does what it takes to get there. No one ever remembers the workers, just the men that elevated them. 

While It's unfortunate his workers aren't treated better, not a single one of them is *forced* into the job, and many use it as the grindstone through which to hone their skills and move onto better quality/higher paying positions elsewhere. While some truly thrive in environments such as that, for anyone who doesn't, other companies know it's a true trial by fire, and anyone who can succeed there for any significant amount of time can truly succeed anywhere. 

My sister is currently working with many of the companies in similar fields as a result of some of the projects at her university; for many of them, they consider it an openly know fact that musk capitalizes on idealists, but those who manage to survive the hard reality of what jobs with him actually entail either flourish, or come out of it within a few years as ideal candidates. They've even told some of her underperforming classmates that, should they need a job in the field, start at spacex/tesla, and hold on for six months, and most anyone will take you afterward. It makes for a great introductory position, if nothing else, simply because of the turnover. 

I don't like it, and I wouldn't do the same in his position; but I'm also not *in* his position, and his personal stance seems to be to prioritize progress. So... even if I wouldn't do the same, I can respect his commitment to a goal at the very least. Should he manage to achieve it, I think the rest of history will look back on him well for it too. While someone can certainly go *way* too far in order to achieve their goals, and pursuit of a goal alone isn't worthy of respect, I feel this is a goal we should *all* want to achieve, and I don't think he's anywhere near that point of lost value... Nothing he's done has been by force, and anyone who can make it there will almost surely be better off for it afterward. Could he do it better? Certainly.

You do realize this already happened, right?  All the claims were dismissed except two.

1. A guy was fired after he came back to work while on medical leave to hand out UAW info.  (he will lose, companies do not allow workers who are on medical leave to come into work)  
2. A guy was fired for sharing info with the UAW that violated his confidentiality agreement.  (I hope he wins, because I doubt he gave the UAW trade secrets that the UAW gave to other car companies, overly broad confidentiality agreements should be void)

So there you have it all the claims of worker abuse and injuries and everything else were all dismissed as not credibly by the NLRB.

There is one single case where the worker may win and it deals with a confidentiality agreement.  That is it.  One employee.

So stop claiming tesla and musk are attacking employees and treating them like shit.  This is one employee out of thousands.

I second this post. You need a lot more facts.

1. Look at his patents. They are design patents. He made Tesla look pretty but there are videos where he claims to spend 80% of his time on ""engineering"". He does have one patent misleadingly titled ""Vehicle"", but it's just images for the design of a vehicle. I think Tesla has filed over 700 patents, and Elon Musk has 4... 3 design, and one for a charging cable.
2. [This SpaceX post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8x4pei/spacex_a_primer/) should explain how he has done nothing at SpaceX, but, by insisting on misleading job titles (Founder, CTO), the real credit for the technology isn't going to Tom Mueller doing the heavy lifting in engineering and technology. You have to research it more though. Musk has no space related patents as a start.
3. He is the face of Tesla. He again has the misleading title of ""Founder and CEO."" As you correctly noted, he's not really a founder. [Here's the email](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/elon-musk-threatening-emails-tesla-press-attention-2014-11) where he's complaining about not being named a founder despite the hard work he put in on Tesla's headlights. The link in the email also points to him threatening his PR firm if they don't turn him into the myth that he is today.
4. Going back to his PR firm, there's also a lot of misinformation being spread.

So just don't make it a hit piece. If you want to write about him misleading people, you need a ""hook"" like something that he said recently that was meant to mislead. The more recent the event, the more newsworthy it is.",e2mheak,1531973940,7/19/2018,musk,July-2018

And on top of all that it would be hundreds of times better to build or devolop the technology that prevents the need to colonize mars because the earth is worse....




Not to mention, it’s been awhile since I have checked but last time I did any reading on it terraforming was nothing but a hypothetical idea, and regardless of any technological breakthroughs or how many steps in the right direction they are, there is a huge probability that even if man does the impossible by developing a way to terraform mars, there is still a huge problem, mars core stopped spinning so any man made atmosphere will be whiped alway.

When I was a Musk fan, I never went to the extremes of the fanboys on Reddit, as I really only admired what he did for is companies, his vision, and more. I knew he was flawed, but not to the extent of the comments on the cave diver (a lot of my views come from the book about him by Ashlee Vance, which is actually pretty decent and somewhat unbiased). Now, I don't defend him for most of the things that he says, and dislike his blatant grabs for attention, yet I still don't detest him with a vitriolic attitude unlike some people. The reason is that I don't want to become as vitriolic as him, and I try to be nice to people, even those who don't have my views. Sorry for my incoherent ramblings! :)

## What is a strawman argument

A *straw man argument* is a rhetoric technique where someone distorts their opponent’s argument, in order to make it easier to attack.

The use of a strawman argument usually consists of the following three stages:

* First, person A states their position.
* Then, person B presents a distorted version of person A’s original position, while pretending that there’s no difference between the two versions.
* Finally, person B attacks the distorted version of person A’s position, and acts as if this invalidates person A’s original argument

You cannot address my points previously stated because quite simply you are wrong.

Never did I once say that Elon Musk personally designed all his rockets. The argument basis is if he does engineering or not. 

"" Please. If he even understood the fundamentals that the people under his employ work with I would he astounded. ""  

How do you know that? What substantial and credible proof do you have that signifies that he doesn't understand the fundamentals other than your own hate-filled, anti-Musk thoughts. 

"" Yes, you're absolutely right! Why does spacex even need rocket scientists when we have Elon Musk personally designing his rockets! ""

26,5098,8xkndo,"This article does a decent job on some parts, but a few notes and corrections.

1.  SpaceX is not batting 1000 vs ULA.  In a five launch block the two heavy launch awards went to ULA and the three lighter ones to SpaceX for Falcon 9.  This was earlier in 2018 -[SOURCE](http://spacenews.com/air-force-awards-big-launch-contracts-to-spacex-and-ula/)
2.  The author makes no mention of EELV phase 2, which is the most important thing to understand to judge SpaceX vs ULA going forwards.  
3.  The idea of how to turn this into investment advice is not useful at best.  The industry of building payloads for space launch is far larger than launch services themselves.  Boeing is a massive player in the satellite building industry for example so to suggest that they aren't going to benefit fully from a new space generation makes no sense.  That's just not how the space industry works.  ULA could lose every contract to SpaceX but if that led to growth in the market and Boeing captures even a tiny percentage of that it would be a net positive for the parent company.

Back to point 2 - EELV-2 is the next long term procurement program for government launches.  It's been passed into law and funded already and the competiton is happening right now behind the scenes.  There are four companies up for 3 development funding spots that will get down selected later this year to 2 development and launch contract spots.  Those four are SpaceX, ULA, Blue Origin, and what was formerly Orbital ATK but is now a division of Northrop Grumman.

SpaceX and ULA are the only currently certified providers in the EELV class.  ULA is the original long term provider but they are also in an ackward spot of having to retire all their current vehicles in favor of a new one.  EELV-2 is going to be bid on exclusively with the future Vulcan rocket by ULA that is still a year or two at best from first flight.  Companies are allowed to submit two proposals so SpaceX might have bid both Falcon 9/Heavy and BFR, but the Falcon 9/Heavy is the shoe in safe bet out of all providers.  It's the only already built and proven vehicle family that is in the competition and is also likely the most cost competitive option.

Blue origin has a potentially great rocket in New Glenn and it would be able to hit all EELV reference orbits in one configuration, but they are a totally unproven provider still and this program really is a year or two early IMO for them to get serious consideration over SpaceX or ULA for a spot.

The last team in is the Orbital ATK OmegA rocket family.  They are a huge military contractor for other products and smaller rockets already even though they have never competed in this market.  We don't know anything about their costs or how seriously the government is taking them as an option.

Safe money is on both current providers SpaceX and ULA making the cut, but an upset here could cause major upheaval.  SpaceX would still have their large NASA contracts and commercial market share and be fine.  ULA depends on their government contracts and it would be catastrophic for them to lose EELV-2.  It could be bad enough for their future outlook that Boeing and Lockheed pull the plug on Vulcan and let ULA wind down while finishing out their current contracts.

I think he just wants to get people on there and set up the structures to let us properly colonize it... that alone will cement his legacy more then anything else. Think about how we still look back at those who managed to colonize N.A., much more the man who managed to colonize an actual *new world.* 

The thing is, I totally agree; I'd have a lot more respect for him if he treated his workers better; but, at the same time, the man clearly has a goal in mind, and cares *way* more about progress then he does what it takes to get there. No one ever remembers the workers, just the men that elevated them. 

While It's unfortunate his workers aren't treated better, not a single one of them is *forced* into the job, and many use it as the grindstone through which to hone their skills and move onto better quality/higher paying positions elsewhere. While some truly thrive in environments such as that, for anyone who doesn't, other companies know it's a true trial by fire, and anyone who can succeed there for any significant amount of time can truly succeed anywhere. 

My sister is currently working with many of the companies in similar fields as a result of some of the projects at her university; for many of them, they consider it an openly know fact that musk capitalizes on idealists, but those who manage to survive the hard reality of what jobs with him actually entail either flourish, or come out of it within a few years as ideal candidates. They've even told some of her underperforming classmates that, should they need a job in the field, start at spacex/tesla, and hold on for six months, and most anyone will take you afterward. It makes for a great introductory position, if nothing else, simply because of the turnover. 

I don't like it, and I wouldn't do the same in his position; but I'm also not *in* his position, and his personal stance seems to be to prioritize progress. So... even if I wouldn't do the same, I can respect his commitment to a goal at the very least. Should he manage to achieve it, I think the rest of history will look back on him well for it too. While someone can certainly go *way* too far in order to achieve their goals, and pursuit of a goal alone isn't worthy of respect, I feel this is a goal we should *all* want to achieve, and I don't think he's anywhere near that point of lost value... Nothing he's done has been by force, and anyone who can make it there will almost surely be better off for it afterward. Could he do it better? Certainly.

It shows RP-1 tank sections, and another first stage with RP1/LOX bulkhead visible and COPV mounts on both sides. There's also the RP1 tank segment on the left, with COPV installed. 

As you say - where else can they be? Except I think the small number and size of the interstage tanks rules out that area. Especially considering the hydraulic system for the grid fins needs power, and stored tank pressure is the most logical source for a system that needs to run while the engines are off. So the two small tanks usually visible up there feed that system.

Plenty of room for nitrogen in the RP1 tank. And flying that stage back probably requires plenty of nitrogen.",e365l4l,1532780113,7/28/2018,spacex,July-2018

Yes but without this contract SpaceX wouldn't exist anymore. There was a good post around here before that explained how the US government basically paid for everything in Space, and specifically how that buoyed SpaceX once they had shown they could build a rocket (Falcon 1).

EDIT - [this is the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8x4pei/spacex_a_primer/)",e2nahlp,1532002923,7/19/2018,spacex,July-2018
126,15330,8ztj80,">If you're going to write a piece, my personal opinion is you need a more neutral viewpoint that doesn't come off as attacking Musk. Instead, it's about taking a fair look at the myths surrounding Elon Musk and the truth behind those myths.

I second this post. You need a lot more facts.

1. Look at his patents. They are design patents. He made Tesla look pretty but there are videos where he claims to spend 80% of his time on ""engineering"". He does have one patent misleadingly titled ""Vehicle"", but it's just images for the design of a vehicle. I think Tesla has filed over 700 patents, and Elon Musk has 4... 3 design, and one for a charging cable.
2. [This SpaceX post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8x4pei/spacex_a_primer/) should explain how he has done nothing at SpaceX, but, by insisting on misleading job titles (Founder, CTO), the real credit for the technology isn't going to Tom Mueller doing the heavy lifting in engineering and technology. You have to research it more though. Musk has no space related patents as a start.
3. He is the face of Tesla. He again has the misleading title of ""Founder and CEO."" As you correctly noted, he's not really a founder. [Here's the email](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/elon-musk-threatening-emails-tesla-press-attention-2014-11) where he's complaining about not being named a founder despite the hard work he put in on Tesla's headlights. The link in the email also points to him threatening his PR firm if they don't turn him into the myth that he is today.
4. Going back to his PR firm, there's also a lot of misinformation being spread.

So just don't make it a hit piece. If you want to write about him misleading people, you need a ""hook"" like something that he said recently that was meant to mislead. The more recent the event, the more newsworthy it is.",e2mheak,1531973940,7/19/2018,spacex,July-2018
130,15443,90plva,"You can call Musk out on his twitter posts and overly optimistic promises without outright lying to your readers. Reading this piece, if you were not familiar with who he is and what he has done, would leave you with the impression that his companies are complete failures. ""He has yet to succeed at anything"" is a direct quote. 

SpaceX is currently the most successful launch company on the planet with the [largest share of commercial launches](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a27290/one-chart-spacex-dominate-rocket-launches/) by far. They just [launched the heaviest commercial satellite ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xybp6zLaGx4) this morning. Tesla is more than a car company. [Its gigafactories have brought the cost of batteries down](https://electrek.co/2017/02/18/tesla-battery-cost-gigafactory-model-3/), [helped stabilize Australia's power grid and brought costs down](https://electrek.co/2018/05/11/tesla-giant-battery-australia-reduced-grid-service-cost/), and is rolling out consumer rooftop solar and battery backup with its [power wall](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/residential-tesla-powerwalls-keep-vermonters-cool/). PayPal is a tremendous success. ",e2tvl8a,1532294358,7/22/2018,spacex,July-2018
131,15451,90plva,"Didn't know about James being on the Tesla board.

Perhaps he wants to oust Musk and had Callahan put out this hit piece.

My initial thought was Callahan was working for someone shorting Tesla stock.

There are plenty of legitimate criticisms of Musk and legitimate reasons for a Tesla shareholder to be concerned about his behavior.

But this piece by Callahan has so many bizarre distortions that I have to think there is a motive behind it.  To say  ""He has yet to succeed at anything""  is absurd.

Yes, Musk may have over-reached with the Model 3 and it might lead to the sale or insolvency of Tesla. But that doesn't mean the company hasn't succeeded in completely changing the public's idea of what an electric car can be. She claims "" the world’s largest automakers quickly surpassed Musk’s vision for electric vehicles"". Really?  

Somehow Nissan says they sold 300,000 Leafs (I don't know where, here in the NYC metro I see at least 10 Teslas for every Leaf), otherwise no maker has come close to selling the 200,000+ Model S and 70,000 Model X electric vehicles that Tesla has sold.

So far the only car on the road that can compare is the Chevy Bolt (total sales about 30,000).  Yes soon the Jaguar i-Pace will be out, eventually followed by the VW group's offerings.

But without Tesla the other automakers would still be building electric cars like the Mitsubishi iMEV and Nissan Leaf. Cars with leisurely acceleration and a 50 - 100 mile range. Cars that are only made so car makers can claim to have zero emission vehicles in their fleet.

And ""  Space X [has been a literal failure to launch](https://nypost.com/2018/01/09/spy-satellite-aboard-spacex-rocket-fails-to-reach-orbit/). "" ???!!

Just this year Space X has had 12 successful launches (and no failures). How does that compare to the competition?  Russia has had 8 launches, Japan 4 launches. Only China is ahead with 20 launches.  And NASA? - zero launches. Oh, NASA has a rocket, they've spent tens of billions working on it for the past decade or two and maybe they'll be ready to launch one in a few years. 

Space X has saved the US gov't tens of millions (perhaps hundreds of millions) of dollars.

By Callahan's standards Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs, Walter Chrysler etc are ""total frauds"".

PS I'm not a Musk fanboy, don't own Tesla stock or a Tesla product but I'd like to see a bit of respect forfacts especially in a publication that claims to be a part of ""the press"".",e2tidln,1532267598,7/22/2018,spacex,July-2018
174,18206,8zrhau,">Perhaps the only thing that makes him stand out from all of the Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires is his marketability as a supergenius.

I used to like him too. This led me to read up on Tesla, and I found out he [retroactively named himself a founder](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8z2szj/coming_from_your_average_elon_fanboy/e2g0uvz) while JB Straubel did the actual work on the battery that made the car possible. Later, I found this sub, and found out Elon Musk [took all the glory for SpaceX](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8x4pei/spacex_a_primer/) even though others, like Tom Mueller you mentioned, were doing the real work. Now, like you, all I see is a big ego willing to say anything (""I spend 80% of my time on engineering"") to boost a manufactured and fraudulent image. Tesla might spend $0 on marketing cars, but it spends millions on marketing Elon Musk. If it makes you feel better, [employees over at SpaceX supposedly can't stand him](https://twitter.com/the_junk_drawer/status/1018515610391572483).",e2l4710,1531917814,7/18/2018,spacex,July-2018
178,19373,922h4o,"Idk, i think spacex is making a really big impact. And if the BFR goes through, which i believe it will, that will be kind of game changing in the way we as a species relate to space",e33hdiu,1532672717,7/27/2018,spacex,July-2018
179,19432,922h4o,"That comparison is really unfair. A slightly more efficient engine traslates in a ton more of payload they can lift, or example, last years they lofted aprox 4.4 tons on a launch which barely could land on the drone ship. The last launch lifted 7.7 tons of payload on the same way. A slightly more efficient rocket is like getting a car with more miles per gallon.

Nevertheless, i dont think spacex is  aiming for deep space exploration. For that be will need some better propulsion system, but currently  the merlin engine is perfect or leavin the atmosphere ",e34tzdg,1532733754,7/27/2018,spacex,July-2018

I try to be healthy skeptic - and I cant be 100% sure he will do that, game is still open. While you are so full of your self and all knowing.

Witch approach is more objective?

And while we have probes to places in solar system, that dont means we dont have to go there as humans. 

Even if SpaceX dont get us to Mars (for whatever reason) - SpaceX already changed space lunch industry so much for the better.

Right now it have around 60% of commercial launches - and what did you do last few years?

49,2587,8zbzma,"Spending big on titles lol.  They created licensing agreements that obligated them to pay off of future expectations of viewership.   This is why in a recent press release their licensing obligations totaled $15 billion.   They created a model for licensing different from that of anything existing in the industry.   They did this at the same time they began offering a free month trial.   This agreement was a huge gamble as it allowed them to not acquire exceassive debt for initial licensing costs with the promise of growing monthly income streams to service agreement costs.   This hinges on a large adpotion rate and continued growth to pay for the past agreed upon rates.   They realixed that model with huge growth and it has been successful.  However lets not forget in 2011 when they made the decision to separate services and increase costs (this was in conjunction with above referenced newly created licensing structure).  The price of shares went from $41 - 9.   7/12/2011 vs.  11/25/2011.  Going from a p/e ratio of ~70 - 16 in that time.  So they went from overpriced to underpriced because of consumer confidence.    Because of the need for subscriber base they invested heavily in expansion.    They began expanding in Europe in 2011 and finished in 2014.   During that time the p/e ratio was as high as 450 - 500.   Ending at 78 in december 2014.   The stock currently trades at a pe ratio of 265.64.  The long term market average is 16.88 based off the schiller p/e ratio.   Today that ratio sits at 32.54.   So people currently pay 8.16 times the market average for every dollar earned by netflix.   Indicating it is largely overvalued, or that the market expects greater future income.   Now lets take a look at cash as you say netflix had plenty of that.   From 2010 to 2011 netflix cash went from 350m to 797.81m.   During that same time they acquired 1.8b in debt.   So to me that looks like they didnt have adequate cash to expand and therefore acquired debt.  (Which would have been far greater had they not structured the licensing the way they did.)   (Also not sure how that is very different from tesla using up large amounts of cash/debt, with agressive expansion plans.)  Now back to Tesla they currently trade at $310/share.   With a negative net income and P/e ratio, what are people paying for?  A future expectation of greater earnings, just like Netflix.  ",e2i9ssc,1531807549,7/17/2018,tesla,July-2018

Think about how we still look back at those who managed to colonize N.A., much more the man who managed to colonize an actual *new world.* 

The thing is, I totally agree; I'd have a lot more respect for him if he treated his workers better; but, at the same time, the man clearly has a goal in mind, and cares *way* more about progress then he does what it takes to get there. No one ever remembers the workers, just the men that elevated them. 

While It's unfortunate his workers aren't treated better, not a single one of them is *forced* into the job, and many use it as the grindstone through which to hone their skills and move onto better quality/higher paying positions elsewhere. While some truly thrive in environments such as that, for anyone who doesn't, other companies know it's a true trial by fire, and anyone who can succeed there for any significant amount of time can truly succeed anywhere. 

My sister is currently working with many of the companies in similar fields as a result of some of the projects at her university; for many of them, they consider it an openly know fact that musk capitalizes on idealists, but those who manage to survive the hard reality of what jobs with him actually entail either flourish, or come out of it within a few years as ideal candidates. They've even told some of her underperforming classmates that, should they need a job in the field, start at spacex/tesla, and hold on for six months, and most anyone will take you afterward. It makes for a great introductory position, if nothing else, simply because of the turnover. 

I don't like it, and I wouldn't do the same in his position; but I'm also not *in* his position, and his personal stance seems to be to prioritize progress. So... even if I wouldn't do the same, I can respect his commitment to a goal at the very least. Should he manage to achieve it, I think the rest of history will look back on him well for it too.

307,15330,8ztj80,">If you're going to write a piece, my personal opinion is you need a more neutral viewpoint that doesn't come off as attacking Musk. Instead, it's about taking a fair look at the myths surrounding Elon Musk and the truth behind those myths.

I second this post. You need a lot more facts.

1. Look at his patents. They are design patents. He made Tesla look pretty but there are videos where he claims to spend 80% of his time on ""engineering"". He does have one patent misleadingly titled ""Vehicle"", but it's just images for the design of a vehicle. I think Tesla has filed over 700 patents, and Elon Musk has 4... 3 design, and one for a charging cable.
2. [This SpaceX post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/8x4pei/spacex_a_primer/) should explain how he has done nothing at SpaceX, but, by insisting on misleading job titles (Founder, CTO), the real credit for the technology isn't going to Tom Mueller doing the heavy lifting in engineering and technology. You have to research it more though. Musk has no space related patents as a start.
3. He is the face of Tesla. He again has the misleading title of ""Founder and CEO."" As you correctly noted, he's not really a founder. [Here's the email](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/elon-musk-threatening-emails-tesla-press-attention-2014-11) where he's complaining about not being named a founder despite the hard work he put in on Tesla's headlights. The link in the email also points to him threatening his PR firm if they don't turn him into the myth that he is today.
4. Going back to his PR firm, there's also a lot of misinformation being spread.

Elon said Tesla would produce 500,000 Model 3s in 2018. Bloomberg estimates that by May of this year, Tesla had only produced 30,735 in TOTAL. His car company has never made a profit in its entire existence.

Well, they just lost a big deal with Panasonic a day ago, and still only produce 1 GW/year of products. It’s also very likely that the company was an elaborate bailout for Elon’s cousins. It’s currently being sued by ex-employees who claim millions of dollars of sales were forged. Solar City still doesn’t make any money.

21,4003,98jrxl,"Fortunately I don’t know any drug addicts but there are many workaholics leaders in the world, I think it is just fine if he chooses to be as is. There is no other way Elon can find peace.  People are overreacting to NYT interview which I think was a bait Elon could have avoided. The most important thing is Model 3 production is improving including the quality so his hard work is showing result. He has many such issues to fix including parts availability, continued production scale up. He is the CEO, he is showing urgency. 

People are overreacting that Elon is losing it, he has gotten reckless,  but wasn’t he the same Elon who wrecked his brand new Mclaren and put all his life worth in spacex? So he has always been like this. ",e4goepj,1534717674,8/19/2018,spacex,August-2018

23,4666,98jrxl,">Are you saying that Model 3 is not being produced?

No, I'm saying the margin busting SR Model 3 isn't being produced. Don't be obtuse.

>Which is why I called Tesla a startup. However, Model 3 production seems to be relatively stable and accelerating as planned, and they are getting there.

Uh, what? He expected to hit 5k\week by december '17. He didn't hit that until when, again? He said they'd hit 20k/week by the end of the year. How's that working out? Accelerating as planned?

>I'm not sure what you're arguing about. Musk himself said that Q3 and Q4 will be profitable and confirmed it again on Q2 earnings call, Model 3 production goals are achieved (after the initial problems that were to be expected), and they are now cashing in with each Model 3 delivery.

They are ""cashing in"" with every PREMIUM model 3 delivery. They won't be ""cashing in"" on SR $35k unicorn 3s.

>That looks like well executed transition from startup phase to Musk's goal of production of mass-market EV.

You have to really be on some righteously strong kool-aid to say ANYTHING about the model 3 release was well executed. Even the most die-hard fan boys admit it was a rocky release.

>Of course (as I implied), for Musk, whole Tesla venture is just one step towards Mars. He's the archetype of startup founder, though the things he tends to start are a bit ambitious so they take several companies to start up.

Actually, Tesla has little to do with Mars, and shows how much you know Musk. He's long claimed he got into the companies he did because he wanted to benefit humanity and that would be done through multiplanetary living (spacex), the internet (paypal), and renewable energy (solar city\tesla). He also mentions AI (tesla) and re-writing genetics (tbd).",e4kkcvd,1534889000,8/21/2018,spacex,August-2018

67,7751,95ezj4, What about the roadster 2 with spacex package ☺,e3tk5r4,1533760410,8/8/2018,spacex,August-2018
111,13813,9auajg,"Musk has radically ideas about stuff that he needs to try out before he accepts that it won't work. Its that simple. He has enough engineering knowledge for him to know what can and can't be done. He is a lot like Jobs in that way. Engineers will push back but so long as something is not impossible, they will be pushed to make it happen. 

For example, the famous story at spacex where they saw a small crack at the edge of an engine nozzle hours before a launch. Instead of scrubbing, Musk asked his engineers if they could simply trim off that section. NASA nearly had an aneurism but his engineers told him it could work for a performance hit. So they did it and launched.

Another example where Musk was amazed when he heard the climate control system inside a fairing would cost a couple million. Volume of the fairing is comparable to that of a house and air conditioning a house doesn't cost anywhere near that. So he forced his engineers to design a system that used commercial AC units.

This is not to say that every idea of his works out. Going with industrial instead of aerospace grade struts lost them a mission. But this is the kind of decision making he is involved in. Musk is not shy about getting technical help but he makes the final decision.

> Tesla is not that proficient on the on-board software as previously thought.

Its not atypical to SV startups. There's plenty of stories about how crappy the code was in the early stages of the famous tech companies. Some parts still are. Shipping is what is prized. So long as tesla goes back and fixes it, they should be fine.",e4yqf0b,1535473873,8/28/2018,spacex,August-2018
112,13818,9auajg,"> For example, the famous story at spacex where they saw a small crack at the edge of an engine nozzle hours before a launch. Instead of scrubbing, Musk asked his engineers if they could simply trim off that section. NASA nearly had an aneurism but his engineers told him it could work for a performance hit. So they did it and launched.

The problem with that approach is that you don't find out the cause of the crack. What if there was something wrong with the fabrication process and other parts of the rocket were riddled with cracks. Or the crack was merely one symptom of some deeper problem elsewhere. What Musk did is the opposite of good engineering. He prioritized his launch over ensuring his system was safe. NASA has been burned too many times by that approach (see Challenger, Columbia, Apollo 1) and naturally would object.

> Another example where Musk was amazed when he heard the climate control system inside a fairing would cost a couple million. Volume of the fairing is comparable to that of a house and air conditioning a house doesn't cost anywhere near that. So he forced his engineers to design a system that used commercial AC units.

Again, not really an example of good engineering, but an example of Musk's ignorance. From that story, it would appear that he doesn't know the difference between a commercial AC unit and a bespoke proper HVAC unit. Commercial AC's aren't designed for those loading conditions, and Musk is tempting fate with every installation. 

In both stories, what I hear is Musk got lucky, and mistook that for being skilled. u/adamjosephcook goes into more detail in his comment, but I'll reiterate the important part. That approach is absolutely unacceptable in safety critical systems.  ",e4yx178,1535486542,8/28/2018,spacex,August-2018
113,13823,9auajg,"Regarding the crack story, they did make sure it was an isolated case and the fix was vetted by the engineers. Musk is a lot more risk-averse when it comes to spacex. I understand why it bothered NASA but they've also become heavily risk-averse.

I would give the spacex engineers some credit. Musk has his ideas but  the devil is in the details and the engineers are the ones who sort all that out. AIUI spacex has done a lot of such in-house designs because Musk has deemed certain things too expensive. Given all the certifications the rockets need for launching various payloads, I imagine they did a good job.",e4yzxm7,1535490073,8/28/2018,spacex,August-2018
114,14028,97oivs,"If you read his biography, the man is hell-bent on saving humanity. The ways he sees to do that are by reducing vehicular pollution, and providing a route to other planets. These have manifested in Tesla, solar city, and spacex. He’s also a bit of an egomaniac, and maybe his success has gone to his head. 

You’re right, this guy does work his employees too hard, but it’s his mission to do what I mentioned above, for better or for worse. 

I attend a target school for Tesla recruiting, and that’s as advertised. You know if you sign up to work for him you will get your ass beat, but you will help achieve his vision. 

Edit: you guys will downvote me no matter what I say, I was trying to be objective. He’s egotistical and does dumb things but he’s still a role model to many of us. ",e49vejl,1534419632,8/16/2018,spacex,August-2018
115,14077,97oivs,"I don’t think we’re going to get anywhere in this argument because we have different dispositions towards the issue. 

I’m not saying Elon isn’t a dick- he conducts himself in a silly way. But he alone has done more to push forward the electric car movement than anyone else- not just through Tesla, but through the competition they’ve created in the market. And the vision of spacex isn’t just for him to have a good time launching spaceships- it’s to build a worldwide, uncensored satellite internet network, that he wants to give for free. That has enormous implications for advancing the third world, not to mention their other goals of interplanetary travel. 

And, yes, if you look at all of history he isn’t the greatest of all time in helping our world, but if you don’t believe he’s one of the greats living today, then you probably don’t understand his work. ",e4bjfc4,1534487621,8/17/2018,spacex,August-2018

The probability of the deal happening is over 90% in my opinion:

- Elon wants it
- the Saudis want it
- Silver Lake Partners has done it with Dell
- Just before the $420 tweet Tesla hired David H. Morton as new Chief Accounting Officer, [who was overseeing Seagate going private](https://1reddrop.com/2018/08/08/teslas-new-chief-accounting-officer-was-at-seagate-when-they-went-private/). He took a significant pay-cut for a significant Tesla options package.

So they have the financing expertise (Silver Lake), the corporate going-private execution expertise (David H. Morton), they have two strong financial partners and the willingness to go private.

I.e. what's left is just quiet negotiations about the details, and a couple of months of deafening noise from the shorts.

> -  bankruptcy
> 
> within a year?

Roughly 0%, barring World War III. The Saudis are clearly hot about Tesla: the worst that can happen at this stage is that there's a sale to them.

Shorts are really underestimating the improving fundamentals and huge future valuation of Tesla, not present on their balance sheet ...

I.e. the short/bear case is looking in the rear window while missing the forest from the trees. Not a safe way to drive when you are short Tesla.",e4goxfy,1534718272,8/19/2018,tesla,August-2018

- FSD: Elon recently estimated that they might be able to do coast-to-coast full self driving later this year. They completed field tests of the Tesla AI chip which increases the computing capacity 10x.
- Alien dreadnought, really?
- Solar roof,  [you must have missed this](https://electrek.co/2018/04/02/tesla-solar-roof-customer-installation-working/), it looks like a real roof to me.

> Also, ""reasonable maintenance times"" for repair work shouldn't be called ""mistimed"" since that's another thing that does not exist.

Growing pains. They recently announced that they are starting to integrate body shops into their service centers, to reduce repair times.

Uh, what? He expected to hit 5k\week by december '17. He didn't hit that until when, again? He said they'd hit 20k/week by the end of the year. How's that working out? Accelerating as planned?

>I'm not sure what you're arguing about. Musk himself said that Q3 and Q4 will be profitable and confirmed it again on Q2 earnings call, Model 3 production goals are achieved (after the initial problems that were to be expected), and they are now cashing in with each Model 3 delivery.

They are ""cashing in"" with every PREMIUM model 3 delivery. They won't be ""cashing in"" on SR $35k unicorn 3s.

>That looks like well executed transition from startup phase to Musk's goal of production of mass-market EV.

You have to really be on some righteously strong kool-aid to say ANYTHING about the model 3 release was well executed. Even the most die-hard fan boys admit it was a rocky release.

>Of course (as I implied), for Musk, whole Tesla venture is just one step towards Mars. He's the archetype of startup founder, though the things he tends to start are a bit ambitious so they take several companies to start up.

Actually, Tesla has little to do with Mars, and shows how much you know Musk. He's long claimed he got into the companies he did because he wanted to benefit humanity and that would be done through multiplanetary living (spacex), the internet (paypal), and renewable energy (solar city\tesla).

Being public also subjects us to the quarterly  earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions  that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the  long-term.""

SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more  operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is  privately held.

I guarantee you the saudis will say they did, even if they did not. They aren't going to smear a man they want to do business with.  Plus lets be honest, if the saudis have met multiple times trying to buy tesla, you know they offered to buy the whole thing in some conversation.  It doesn't matter if they wanted less than 100%, simply offering to buy it all to get musk's attention backs up the tweet.  That is the power of someone sitting on a pile of cash.  Their offers are real.",e4bj7ul,1534487426,8/17/2018,tesla,August-2018
275,13813,9auajg,"Musk has radically ideas about stuff that he needs to try out before he accepts that it won't work. Its that simple. He has enough engineering knowledge for him to know what can and can't be done. He is a lot like Jobs in that way. Engineers will push back but so long as something is not impossible, they will be pushed to make it happen. 

For example, the famous story at spacex where they saw a small crack at the edge of an engine nozzle hours before a launch. Instead of scrubbing, Musk asked his engineers if they could simply trim off that section. NASA nearly had an aneurism but his engineers told him it could work for a performance hit. So they did it and launched.

Another example where Musk was amazed when he heard the climate control system inside a fairing would cost a couple million. Volume of the fairing is comparable to that of a house and air conditioning a house doesn't cost anywhere near that. So he forced his engineers to design a system that used commercial AC units.

This is not to say that every idea of his works out. Going with industrial instead of aerospace grade struts lost them a mission. But this is the kind of decision making he is involved in. Musk is not shy about getting technical help but he makes the final decision.

> Tesla is not that proficient on the on-board software as previously thought.

Its not atypical to SV startups. There's plenty of stories about how crappy the code was in the early stages of the famous tech companies. Some parts still are. Shipping is what is prized. So long as tesla goes back and fixes it, they should be fine.",e4yqf0b,1535473873,8/28/2018,tesla,August-2018
276,13817,9auajg,">He has enough engineering knowledge for him to know what can and can't be done.

We will have to agree to disagree on this - which is fine. I do not agree and I see no compelling direct evidence for this.

>Shipping is what is prized. So long as tesla goes back and fixes it, they should be fine.

**I do not agree with this.**

You cannot apply this thinking to safety-critical systems in particular - something Silicon Valley has not had to deal with often until now.

The fact is that we already have one or two examples where the Autopilot is suspected to play a role in fatalities.

In terms of SpaceX and your other comments, I submit we do not know for sure how much can actually be attributed to Mr. Musk personally. But, more than that, Mr. Musk has never had to wear a black armband at SpaceX and hopefully he never will.

""Move fast and break things"" is **unethical** in **safety-critical systems** (like rockets and cars and any hardware/software that directly impacts human life and limb). That is a cornerstone of physical engineering and is burned into the minds of all engineers at engineering school. Fine for Facebook. Not fine for cars.

I have never heard many of these stories you cite before curiously enough. Depending on how Mr. Musk ""pushed"" his engineers, it could very well be unethical (not concluding something either way because obviously I was not there).

I do not want to get too far down the Tesla/SpaceX rabbit hole here, but, based on your comment, I would also say that if the BOD is looking for a #1 or #2 executive for Tesla - this person would hopefully challenge Mr. Musk if decisions were made on ""just shipping it"" instead of ""safety first"".

And, perhaps, that is another problem with finding a #2 at Tesla.",e4yrwj2,1535477267,8/28/2018,tesla,August-2018
277,13821,9auajg,"I think he feels he NDA was for IP, and not office gossip. Whether correct or not, he feels it he isn't revealing secrets. Also, he may have had a personal lawyer negotiating his employee contract.

Reading the original source, he also discussed that it really wasn't a huge deal and tesla likely fixed almost all of the stuff and he worked on code that had been revised and changed for years after he left.

He said (other than autopilot) T was hugely safety first for the end user, and other positives. Much more nuanced than the twitter excerpts. ",e4z3bqr,1535493594,8/28/2018,tesla,August-2018
278,13822,9auajg,"That thread was not about safety critical stuff though was it. I only skimmed through it so I might have missed something. 

Musk's role is really not all that surprising or different compared to other CEOs. He just gets more involved in the design and engineering side of things. Like Sergei Brin does at Alphabet. Complaints about Musk have never been about lack of intelligence or knowledge. He just happens be a ""first principles"" guy rather than ""conventional wisdom"".

The problem with Musk has not really been on the technical side of things. Its the other stuff. I don't think Shotwell has ever pushed back on Musk's technical decisions. That's the job of the various engineering heads. I suspect the job description will be same for a tesla #2.

280,13829,9auajg,">They want someone to handle the business side of things.

I agree.

I would also recommend, though, that Tesla try to:

\- Get some automotive/Semi truck manufacturing experience on the Board. /u/jjlew080 and others have noted this and I very much agree.

\- Rebuild some of the C-suite technical/engineering talent. From their [management page](http://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/management) and the press, it is unclear how much is remaining after the Model 3 program and how high that technical talent goes.

At least on a purely technical basis, I think that this would go a long way towards getting Tesla to that promised land of tried-and-true automotive manufacturing lessons and new, big thinking. Mr. Musk will get some much needed rest and Tesla will be better off.

Mr. Musk will have to relinquish quite a bit of control here, but it would still be his ship.",e4yvmje,1535484488,8/28/2018,tesla,August-2018

FSD is close to solved, IMO. Maybe not by tesla, but the same way alpha zero taught itself to play chess in a few hours, and now beats everything, or openai beats the best humans in dota (from scratch)... Neural nets will beat humans at driving. That's also evolutionary.

Maybe tesla and AP 3 can't, but it you have enough tensor cores and training data, it will be here.

Although I don't see how tesla can do auto lane change safely now when they seem to have issues with a closing car at high delta V, AP seems to have happy consumers and should get better, why do they ""need to figure it out""?

This included discussion as to how being private could better serve Tesla’s long-term interests, and also addressed the funding for this to occur. The board has met several times over the last week and is taking the appropriate next steps to evaluate this.

Elon said Tesla would produce 500,000 Model 3s in 2018. Bloomberg estimates that by May of this year, Tesla had only produced 30,735 in TOTAL. His car company has never made a profit in its entire existence.

In late 2015, Elon said [“Tesla cars will reach 620 miles on a single charge within a year or two, and be fully autonomous within three years”.](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/29/elon-musk-says-tesla-cars-will-reach-620-miles-on-a-single-charge-within-a-year-or-two-have-fully-autonomous-cars-in-three-years/#.zgnb0e:vdpc) Neither have happened.

Let’s not forget Solar City. Back in 2016, Elon said their Buffalo plant would eventually reach 10 GW/year of solar products. Well, they just lost a big deal with Panasonic a day ago, and still only produce 1 GW/year of products. It’s also very likely that the company was an elaborate bailout for Elon’s cousins. It’s currently being sued by ex-employees who claim millions of dollars of sales were forged. Solar City still doesn’t make any money.

And last but not least, Hyperloop is a pipe dream that will never be finished. Elon doesn’t get an excuse for “eventually delivering”. Until the product shows any signs of being attainable, and given Elon’s extensive track record, he gets no credit from me for it.",e4ahy1o,1534455299,8/16/2018,tesla,August-2018

Your argument is that no work is notable, since it's all about standing on the shoulders of giants.

We should all credit Isaac Newton for anything that's happened since the 16th century, then. And none of the work since then is notable.

That was barely an engine! It was a thing on a test stand, and it was canceled after the first test. It couldn't have worked on a rocket.

Full flow is an old concept which solves an obvious problem with seals and unintentional mixing of fuels, but no full-flow engines have ever flown.

Raptor will be the first one.

That question is incorrect.

They don't patent things, because the Chinese would use the patents to their own advantage.

I did watch the entire video and it is patently obvious that Musk was set up, Rogan waited until 2:09:30 into the interview and under the pretext of showing him a container he bought in Mexico, handed Musk a blunt and asked if it would fit. Following a number of inexplicable edits the camera cuts to Musk holding the blunt. We're not shown how much persuasion it took. Nor the part where some offscreen individual handed Musk the whiskey glass.

2:09:30: Rogan: I got that in Mexico, I was hoping it holds joints.  (reaching for a joint, gives knowing look to off screen figure)  

Musk: does it do anything  

Rogan: no, it's just a holder, but like, try and put a joint in there and close it. (hands musk the joint) , you put one, one blunt. One, that seems pretentious. you know, that's the idea behind it. I bought it when I was in Mexico and figured it would be a good size to hold joints (lights joint).  

Musk: Is that a joint .. or is it a cigar?  

Rogan, no  

Musk: ok  

Rogan: it's um marijuana  

Musk: it's weed?  

Rogan: inside of tobacco.  

Musk: ok, so it's like posh pot tobacco pot?  

Rogan: You never had that?  

Musk: yea, I think I tried one once. (2:10:16: seems edited at this point, leaving out the point where Rogan offered the joint to Musk)  

Rogan: come on man, you probably can't because of the stock holders right.  

Musk: I mean it's legal right?  

Rogan: it's all legal.  

Musk: ok (takes joint from Rogan)  

Rogan: How does that work, do people get upset at you, if you do certain things. That's tobacco and marijuana in there, that's all it is. The combination of tobacco and marijuana is wonderful, first turned onto it by Charlie Murphy and then re-ignited by Dave Chappelle, there you go.  

Musk: plus whiskey (2:10:47: Yet another edit, Musk handed Whiskey by off screen figure) .. ha haa exactly.  

Rogan: perfect, balances it out.  

Musk: alcohol is a drug, it's been grandfathered in  

Rogan: well it's not just a drug, it's a drug that gets a bad rap, because if you just have a little, it's great.  

Musk: Fine

132,5822,9fth3t,"Do you see this as ""hidden risk"" for a **good** Q3/Q4? Sort of like a [Pyrrhic Victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory)?

Let me know if I am off-base on my thinking here. Feel free to push back.

You have called for more technical/automotive expertise on the Board and within Tesla's upper management. Now, some of Tesla's supportive investors and analysts have called for the same in recent weeks.

From a **technical standpoint** and looking at Tesla's future project schedule, I agree. Tesla is already gearing up, in fact, to be quite ambitious with a [Semi production schedule](https://electrek.co/2018/09/12/tesla-semi-production-volume-2020-gigafactory-1/) in an industry where Model 3 problems will not fly at all.

But, I am sort of wondering what will be the ""catalyst"" for change at Tesla will be.

Let's say that Q3/Q4 pull down some really good numbers.

That could suppress any talk of shaking up the Board and getting some serious technical chops in the C-suite. Perhaps suppress it until the next production program disaster when the economic conditions may not be on your side like they are today, competition is more fierce and the Tesla fervor (or whatever) dies down a bit.  Mr. Musk could feel validated/vindicated and could also feel that he may not need anyone **strong** to work with anymore because the Model 3 program pulled through.

Where Mr. Musk sees skill. I see luck (for the most part). And I would not play this ""Model 3 chicken"" again with Model Y or the Semi.

Conversely, let's say that Q3/Q4 are disasters (well, for Tesla's sake, maybe just moderate misses). That could be enough to drive change - on the Board and in the C-suite. Change that I submit could benefit Tesla **in the long-run**.

Maybe this is what Gene Munster and Romit Shah see? Maybe. Maybe not.

Naturally, you cannot ignore the financial impact of a poor showing in Q3/Q4, but what do you see as the change catalyst here? Do you agree with my risk assessment above - perhaps partially?

304,15172,9djlyu,"With reference to your so called  ""laws of economics"", which is neither a law or anything to seriously economics when simply talking about cheap labour without reference to end quality and human labour input as a % total battery costs, Tesla does what it does based on the effects of cumulative experience. Google tesla, battery, experience curve. There's actually a scientific paper that covers this.",e5kc196,1536367577,9/7/2018,tesla,September-2018
305,15179,9djlyu,"Isn't tesla planning to build gigafactories all over the world? They know how to do it first. I thought automation was key to driving down costs - not low wages. Also, wages are on the rise in developing nations.

You can use your argument to downplay any innovative company - ""Oh we can pay people less over here and do exactly the same thing!"". It isnt that black and white. There are business relationships, capitol investment, laws, risk of existing competition etc that get in the way. If tesla could buy batteries cheaply (or pay another company to get on with large scale battery production) they wouldn't be building the gigafactory in the first place.

Are US customers going to buy their cars from the company that uses chinese batteries? The main ingredient. Are people buying chinese petrol engines? (i actually don't know, not a rhetorical question)",e5jydfa,1536355308,9/7/2018,tesla,September-2018
